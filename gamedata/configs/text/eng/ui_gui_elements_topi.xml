		<text>Metamizole sodium (Analgin) is a drug, analgesic and antipyretic of the pyrazolone group. Withdrawn from circulation in many countries because of the risk of agranulocytosis.
	    It belongs to the NSAID group of pyrazolone derivatives. The mechanism of action is similar to other NSAIDs (non-selectively blocks COX and reduces prostaglandin formation from arachidonic acid). Prevents conduction of pain extra- and proprioreceptive impulses through Gaul and Bourdach bundles, increases threshold of excitability of thalamic centres of pain sensitivity, increases heat dissipation.
		Indications\nFeverish syndrome (infectious-inflammatory diseases, insect bites - mosquitoes, bees, gadflies, etc., post-transfusion complications); Pain syndrome (mild to moderate intensity): including neuralgia, myalgia, arthralgia...
		Privately recommended for hypotension and thready pulse.

		<text>Vicasol. Vicasol takes part in the formation of prothrombin by the liver and helps to normalise blood clotting. The action of Vicasol appears 12-18 hours after injection.
        Indications for use.\nHypo-and avitaminosis K, obstructive jaundice, acute hepatitis, parenchymal, capillary, hemorrhoidal, gastric, intestinal, nasal and pulmonary bleeding; Injuries, operations, radiation sickness, thrombocytopenic purpura, last month of pregnancy (to prevent haemorrhage in newborns), uterine juvenile and premenopausal bleeding, spontaneous bleeding in preparation for operations with difficult haemostasis, septic diseases with haemorrhagic phenomena, overdose of anticoagulants (dicumarin, phenylline).
		In special cases it is recommended for use in case of patient's state of shock.

    <string id="st_mm_med_helper_descr_3">
		<text>Dicinon. Hemostatic drug. Its hemostaticatic effect is based on the intensification of the first step of the haemostasis mechanism (endothelium-platelet interaction). It is proved that Dicynon increases platelet adhesion, stabilises the capillary walls, thus reducing their permeability, inhibits the synthesis of those prostaglandins that cause platelet disaggregation, vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. 
This leads to a shorter bleeding time and reduced blood loss. Dicynon has no effect on the coagulation mechanism, prothrombin time, fibrinolysis and platelet levels (normal). It is recommended for low blood platelet counts.

		<text>Dioxidine is a domestic synthetic broad-spectrum AMP. It was approved for medical use in 1976. 
Due to peculiarities of toxicology with systemic action (IV) it is used only by vital indications for treatment of severe forms of anaerobic or mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections caused by multiresistant strains when other AMPs are ineffective or intolerant. In severe purulent infections it can be used in the cavity, endobronchially, topically.
Mechanism of action\nDioxidine has a bactericidal effect, the mechanism of which is not fully understood. Dioxidine activity is enhanced in anaerobic environment due to induction of reactive oxygen species formation. In special cases it is recommended to use in low blood leucocyte counts.</text>

I am scared. The overlay of civility has proved too thin. First we have been driven, each of us individually, into an animal state by constant threats, public torture and abuse.

The answer is simple and floats to the surface: half a century of double standards and blatant double-dealing has created an illusion of impunity for many groups that operate under the wings of a number of governments. We ourselves have nurtured a new strain of the plague. A moral plague. This is especially clear from here, at the bottom of the abyss into which we have fallen.

		<text>One day while Muhammad was sleeping near Al-Qaaba, he was awakened by Jibril. The angel had brought with him an extraordinary beast called Burak and told him that it had carried all the Prophets and that it would now carry Muhammad. Muhammad boarded the Burak which carried him by air to Jerusalem. There he met Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), Isa (Jesus) and other prophets. 
They all prayed together and Muhammad led the prayer, then he was offered a drink from three vessels: water, wine and milk. Muhammad chose the milk jar, and that meant his congregation was on the right path. Wine, on the other hand, has been forbidden to Muslims ever since.
Then a ladder descended to him, on which he and Jibril ascended to the seven heavens. In the lower heaven He saw Adam deciding the fate of the souls of the dead. The angels showed Muhammad hell, and he felt the heat of the fire and saw the terrible torment of sinners. As He ascended from heaven, He met the Prophets: on the second, Isa; on the third, Jusuf; on the fourth, Idris; on the fifth, Harun; on the sixth, Musa; on the seventh, Ibrahim....

		<text>...Then Muhammad visited Paradise, where he saw the bliss of the believers. Then Allah spoke to him and obliged Muslims to pray 50 times a day. When Muhammad went back down, Musa persuaded him to return to Allah and ask Him to reduce the number of prayers. This was repeated several times until the number of prayers for the Muslims was reduced to five a day.
When Muhammad told of his journey, he was not believed. People said, "The caravan goes there for a whole month, how can you fly there in one night?" Even Abu Bakr, a loyal friend of his, had doubts. 
Then Muhammad described to him the Jerusalem he had seen from above, which he had never been to before. These descriptions matched Abu Bakr's memories of the city and Muhammad's words were confirmed to be true. Muhammad also told of a caravan which he had also seen from above. 
The caravan arrived in Mecca some time later and his story was confirmed.

		<text>One day a mullah came into the hall to address the worshippers. The hall was empty except for a young stable boy who sat in the front row. The mullah thought to himself: "Should I speak or not?" So he ventured to ask the groom:
- There is no one here but you, do you think I should speak or not? The groom replied:
- Sir, I am a simple man, I know nothing about it. But when I come to the stable and see that all the horses have scattered and there is only one left, I will still give it something to eat.
The mullah, taking these words to heart, began his sermon. He spoke for more than two hours and when he finished he was relieved. He wanted to hear confirmation of how good his speech had been. He asked:
- How did you like my sermon? - I have already said that I am a simple man and do not really understand it all. But if I come to the stable and see that all the horses have scattered and there is only one left, I will feed her anyway. But I don't give her all the feed that is meant for all the horses.

And when he saw the sun rising, he said: "This is my Lord, he is the greater!" 
And when it had set, he said: "O my people, I have no part in that which you give Him as a partner.

		An eastern ruler wanted to know the whole history of mankind. A wise man brought him five hundred volumes. Busy with affairs of state, the king sent him away, commanding him to put it all in a shorter form.
After twenty years the wise man returned: the history of mankind now occupied only fifty volumes, but the king was already too old to be able to cope with so many thick books, and sent the wise man away again.
Another twenty years passed, and the aged, gray-haired sage brought the king a single volume containing all the wisdom of the world that he longed to know. The king, however, was on his deathbed, and had no time to read even one of the books.
Then the wise man expounded to him the history of mankind in a single line, and it read: "Man is born, suffers and dies.
