I'll tell you an interesting story. There was one guy, he was called Cook. Not because he cooked, but because he could smell the meat grinders a hundred paces away. So he got cocky. I say, every day I save you from a fierce death, and Chapaev gives me the same share of the spoils. He's forgotten who he's under, you louse... I called him out and knocked him unconscious. While he was lying there, I broke his fingers, the bitch. Then the boys blindfolded him, twisted his arms and took him to the right place. I decided: if he walks a hundred paces, I'll leave him alive. But he didn't make it: just at his favourite "Meat Grinder" he ran into it. Once a cook, now a mincemeat. What? Don't spoil it!</text>

There's a topic - I missed my torch, an imported one. The topic was this: I was walking through a petrol station one night. And not alone, but with three brothers, and with a Spas. It was quiet, the moon was shining, everything was fine, just like in a graveyard. I'm just a little bit too drunk to drink. Come on, let's go... we're talking. Suddenly there's a rustle from under the bushes on our left, we're shooting, then a rustle from the right, then right and left... ...we're cheating and start shooting in all directions... We looked round bushes - nobody. Well, I thought, they squirreled the squirrel together with boys... A minute later the rustles came up again, we started shooting again... but nothing; not even a bloody trace of the creature we thought we'd shot at... and then one of the brothers gets jumped by a boar, from the back... took the boar down, the brother's alive. After that, we overdid it and drove to the base. And already near base I - in pockets, and there - a dick, no torch. I haven't been to the petrol station since, but I'm sure my torch is in there somewhere. I want you to go over there and find my torch. Can you do that?</text>

There is a topic - I missed my torch, an imported one. The subject was as follows: I was walking once through "Emerald" at night. And not alone, but with three brothers, and with Spas atop. It was all quiet around, the moon was shining - in short, everything was as on a cemetery. I'm just a little bit too drunk to drink. Come on, let's go... we're talking. Suddenly there's a rustle from under the bushes, on our left; we immediately shot up the guns, then - shit, rustle on the right, then right and left... ...we're cheating and start shooting in all directions... We looked round bushes - nobody. Well, I thought, they squirreled the squirrel together with boys... A minute later the rustles came up again, we started shooting again... but nothing; not even a bloody trace of the creature we thought we'd shot at... and then one of the brothers gets jumped by a boar, from the back... took the boar down, the brother's alive. After that, we overdid it and drove to the base. And already near base I - in pockets, and there - a dick, no torch. I haven't been to Emerald since, but my torch is lying there somewhere.

		<text>Yes, you know, I am familiar with this device. It is designed to transmit high-frequency radio waves over very long distances, I would even say astronomical. It was developed by our radio engineering department at the Jupiter plant, but we didn't get any further work - the device weighed 200 kg and the bosses didn't like it, our project was soon frozen. I was very young at the time and worked as a junior researcher. But my career there did not work out because of an emergency evacuation at the beginning of 2006 and not because the project was stopped. The device you are interested in was hastily packed together with other valuable equipment and taken out of the Zone. However, some of the equipment was left, for reasons unknown to me, lying in the factory. Since I have not heard anything about the repeater in scientific circles since then, I must assume that it is still in the Zone. Here are the coordinates of the approximate location of the equipment depot. It's possible the subspace repeater is still in one of the containers.</text>

		<text>Yes, you know, I am familiar with this device. It is designed to transmit high-frequency radio waves over very long distances, I would even say astronomical. It was developed by our radio engineering department at the Jupiter plant, but we didn't get any further work - the device weighed 200 kg and the bosses didn't like it, our project was soon frozen. I was very young at the time and worked as a junior researcher. But my career there did not work out because of an emergency evacuation at the beginning of 2006 and not because the project was stopped. The device you are interested in was hastily packed together with other valuable equipment and taken out of the Zone. However, some of the equipment was left, for reasons unknown to me, lying in the factory. Since I have not heard anything about the repeater in scientific circles since then, I must assume that it is still in the Zone. Here are the coordinates of the approximate location of the equipment depot. It's possible the subspace repeater is still in one of the containers.</text>

		<text>I don't remember it well... by a miracle, I guess. I was on the fourth - we were flying calmly... all of a sudden, rumble, smoke... it stunned me... and then, like a kick... I was thrown out of the chopper and into the sky. I don't remember how I opened the parachute and how I landed. I woke up not far from some power station... I don't know, I couldn't see. I didn't have time to come to my senses yet, and here - dogs! Five of them! If Garik hadn't come, they'd have eaten me! But all's well that ends well... I came here to Jupiter with Garik. And here I already went to the control point - without result, there's nobody there and, as it seems, wasn't. Besides, I got a little information - rumours abound. I hope it will be useful to you. So, half the expedition died in the Zaton area. One was in the South Plateau, the other fell into the swamp, and the third crashed at the substation. I don't know anything about the others, and I don't know where mine is either. I can't transmit coordinates yet, my PDA's out of power... As soon as it comes back on, I'll send you the information you need, so you can go back to Zaton. I think by the time you get there, my PDA will be working. Oh, and by the way, the helicopter doors might be locked electronically, so take my universal pilot key, you should have it now.</text>

		<text>Selection is the chemical processing of atoms, which results in a change in the structure of the atom. The reaction happens very quickly, within about 10 seconds, which is enough time for an object to start changing. For artefacts in particular, 3 types of selection can be used:\n1)Radiation.\n2)Weighting.\n3)Restoration.\n Cost of selection respectively - 26000, 24500, 30000 rubles. Any artefact can withstand only one chemical treatment, otherwise it will be destroyed.</text>

		<text>You see, friend... a long time ago, about six months ago, I lost my gun... here, almost already on approaches to Pripyat. Then I was in Kopachi village, well, where there were only hills instead of houses; I was looking for the artefacts there, and zombies were quite docile then, so I was hit with backhoe, struck straight on the loft. I don't know who it was, but still, when I woke up, my gun was gone. Although I did not understand what had happened at the time, because I was in shock. But I do remember that I tried to move my hands around, looking for the gun... I guess that bastard whistled, good thing I survived.</text>

		<text>I don't remember anything else. I just remember that the stalkers took me out and that's it. You know, after I got better, I wanted to go there again, to look for my gun, but my friends stopped me. They said there's been zombies living there for a long time, and more and more have been showing up lately, with guns... ...and it's not easy to get through. Unless you have a posse... five men... and I don't think anybody's gonna go with me for no reason. I don't know if that's where my bagpipes are. Anyway, I'd like someone to check out the place in this unfortunate village. I can't do it yet, because I'm not armed. Will you do it? I think I can raise six thousand for the reward. Huh?</text>

Such possibilities for experimentation cannot be created in any laboratory! I am sure: a few more years and, thanks to research of the Zone, there will be a qualitative leap in science, in many spheres of economic activity of mankind. Even those who do not know how to use a mobile phone will feel it. In short - we continue the work of the "Clear Skies" clan. Our clan consists mainly of former members of Clear Skies.

And that mutant turned out to be... ...you know who?...you wouldn't believe it, a common marmot. Back at the base, he started annoying everyone, saying, what kind of creature is this, what kind of creature, in his homeland such insignificant creatures have never been seen... Now the nerd is asking our guys to bring him a camera, but they are mocking him, wanting him to go and get it himself.

We understand that until we have enough dynamite to detonate the dens, stopping the onslaughts of these creatures is a lost cause.

		<text>Melnik, my best friend, is missing. Melnik had the same job in the zone as I did - he was a guide. I remember: three days ago, when I was still on Janova, Melnik was going to take unknown stalkers from Jupiter to Pripyat, but they for some reason postponed the campaign for the next day, and by this time I was already here. Since then, not a word, and one thing remains - the signal of his PDA, which comes directly from the overpass "Pripyat-1". Unfortunately, now I can not go there with you, because I have an important meeting with clients, so I decided to ask you to go and check. Will you help?</text>

They've occupied the Bookstore, our temple! And for that they must pay. Lead our brothers into battle. Punish them, cleanse them of their filth and rebuild our temple!

We are growing stronger by the day, and all thanks to you. You have contributed so much to our clan, and you have not betrayed our faith in times of need, as apostates have done. Your merits will not go unnoticed. From now on, the brothers will call you Adept. You are now our new spiritual leader. Serve the Monolith, guide our brothers to the true path and communicate its will to them. Visit your brothers in the temple tomorrow, they will have to finish the repairs.

		<text>Do you remember what happened to you?</text>.
	</string>
        <string id="pri_monolit_brother_leader_dialog_5">
		<text>We don't remember much of our past lives. Everything was like a dream. I remember our group was big. We were in some factory looking for something, something important and very expensive. Then there was, I think, a controller, I remember a strong psi-punch, great pain... He managed to subdue us all and led us to some building. Then an unscheduled ejection began, the four of us were caught by it, the rest managed to be led away by the controller into the depths of the building. It was the Monolith that saved us! We were left to our own devices and heard his voice. In our zombie state, he became our guiding star, and we went for him. The monolith spoke to us and guided us! Next I remember a river with concrete banks, a canal I think, and a huge wasteland with buildings on the horizon. Not a single creature attacked us along the way - the Monolith was protecting us on the way there! Then there was a deserted town and houses, lots of houses with windows blown out. Pripyat! Suddenly Monolith's voice cut off and we didn't know where to go next. We were found and sheltered by the Monoliths. They took care of us and were waiting for some man with medicine. And then you helped us to come back to life, and the veil fell from our minds. Thank you again, brother. Thanks to you we have found a new family and we are happy now. Take our former weapons and equipment, the Monolith gives us everything we need. We don't need these things anymore.</text>

In general, stubborn bitch, it turned out. Even Sultan and Sych talked, and not to send him to the nearest anomaly, but the only other technicians at Zatona can not find a day away from Zharka. So I went out of my way to please everyone. I got in touch with the right people and they helped me as much as they could. But it's always happens: their man contacted me, saying "meet me, I won't go to you across the Zaton without a guide". I went to see the pilot; it was his specialty. He agreed and left. An hour later he came back: "Your messenger had disappeared". No stalker goes to look for him at night. That was the end of our agreement with the guide. But it doesn't make me feel any better. In short, talk to him, maybe he'll tell you in what area he was looking for a messenger, and start searching from there. Maybe you'll get lucky.</text>

		<text>The Exclusion Zone now stretches south of the Chernobyl nuclear plant and covers an area of 40 square kilometres, bounded by a triple perimeter ring guarded by the military content of NATO countries as well as Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Its entire territory is divided into several sectors where there is less anomalous activity compared to the rest of the territory. The rest of the area is considered impassable due to high radiation levels and the presence of giant anomalous fields. However, after some particularly intense releases the Zone may change its usual boundaries, as well as shifting the anomalous fields within itself - thereby opening up previously inaccessible areas. And to some, on the contrary, it erases any known accesses. It was the way it was in 2011 when Limansk sector was finally opened, while generators' area north of ChNPP, better known as Tesla zone, was cut off by an impassable anomalous field. There are also natural obstacles that prevent stalkers from moving deeper into the Zone. This is the infamous Radar-a psi unit controlled by the Monolith clan. It's the Radar that separates the Northern Zone from the Central and Southern. I can tell you more about known locations in the northern, central and southern parts of the Zone. Separately, we should highlight the complexes of secret laboratories which exist within the Chernobyl Zone. True information about them through skimpy and incomplete.

This is actually Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant - the heart of the Zone, to break through to which many sought, but managed only to unity; generators or Tesla Zone, as it is also called, a small area north of the plant - according to one of the legends it was there, rather than at the plant occurred the second explosion, Pripyat City - a former town of power engineers servicing Chernobyl, is now a ghost town, controlled by the group Monolith; The territories adjacent to the western outskirts of Pripyat are a not safe area, where there are complexes of the "Jupiter" plant, the village of Kopachi, and Yaniv Station; Zaton is a vast swampy area of the Pripyat River floodplain, located to the north of Yaniv Station; and Sulfur Cornon, the northern boundary of the Zone, located further from Zaton. In general, I'll choose - I will tell more about them.</text>

But it is not the lack of life, the empty squares and abandoned machinery, the dust and debris rising in the wind, the howling of the beasts, or even the occasional blaze which no one puts out, because no one is even here, but rather the inexplicable sense that there is some sort of observer. There is someone else, a hostile and inhospitable host! It is as if with every second you spend here you sink deeper and deeper into an otherworldly timelessness and, at some point, there will be no escape.</text>

There is no detailed information about what is really going on in the Tesla Zone, as most stalker expeditions have gone missing.

		<text>The western and eastern parts of the city are separated from each other by impenetrable anomalous fields. To cross from one part of the city to the other requires the use of underground utilities, teeming with mutants. Eastern part of the city: the intersection of Druzhba Narodov Street and Kurchatov Street. Among the strategically important objects there is only a small river station with the adjacent building of "Pripyat" cafe. It is an ideal place for setting up a fortified point, as from the roof of the cafe the whole of Kurchatov Street is shot through, while from the roof of the railway station Druzhba Narodov Street is also shot through. Additionally, in case of simultaneous seizure of the "Prometheus" cinema building with the adjacent music school, from where the entire centre of the city is under fire, virtually the entire district is under control and it would be extremely difficult to dislodge the enemy who has entrenched on these spots. Among large buildings where the enemy may entrench themselves the city hospital with the outpatient clinic MSCh-126 and Pripyat Secondary School 1 in the northern part of the district, as well as a complex of hostels in the south, connected through the building of the canteen "Vstrecha". The western district of Pripyat includes the main streets together with the park area where the famous Ferris ring is located. There is also a sports complex, which offers access to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. To date, much of Pripyat is controlled by the Monolith faction.</text>

    <string id="zat_shram_informator_about_zone_type_nouth_okrjup_descr">
		<text>Located to the west of the outskirts of Pripyat. The key facility in the area is the Jupiter industrial plant. Officially, before the accident, the plant was a branch of the Kiev plant "Mayak" and produced rollers of tape drives for household tape recorders. In reality, however, the plant worked for the Ministry of Defence and was engaged in the development of advanced weapons. Direct transport links link the factory to a transit and trans-shipment depot in the south-west of the area and to a concrete factory in the north-east. In addition to the general industrial infrastructure, there are cooling towers in the northwestern part of the area that supply cold water for technical purposes to both plants. Also present in the area is an abandoned S-75 surface-to-air missile system in a modern variant, Volkhov, which controlled the airspace within a radius of 40 kilometres. Representatives of illegal armed groups have set up a large camp in the station building of the Janov railway station. A full-fledged trade in armoured suits of various classes and weapons, both domestic and foreign-made, has been established. There is a small repair shop. Two opposing factions, the Freedom and the Duty, control the area simultaneously, and an armistice agreement is in effect within the station building. There are also small bases of the Rasvet and Mercenary factions. The research group occupies a mobile bunker in the immediate vicinity of the Janov station. The area is heavily populated by mutants, and is one of the most dangerous areas of the Zone in terms of mutants.</text>

A few abandoned farmsteads can also be found in this area. To the north lie the former ladders and the famous Preobrazhensk? bridge. The only safe place is Skadovsk, where there is a shaky truce between factions. It is distinguished by the presence of a large number of so called Archianomalies such as the Claw, the Sosnovodub, the Circus and others. Therefore, these places are considered very rich in artefacts, so the main factions found here are neutrals, as well as bandits trying to control them. Occasionally the Dawn Clan's vagrants, as well as mercenaries, drop in here. Mutants are often found here, but still their population is lower than in other sectors.</text>

		<text>This is the northernmost point of the zone its top gate. In essence, this place is a bit like Southern Cordon, the only difference being that it is more dangerous in every way. Anomalous activity is rather high, but gradually decreases towards the northern boundary. Mutants are more common in the dense forest belt. There are more artefacts than in Southern Kordon, but many fewer than in other parts of the Zone. The military have a great influence here, and even have a well-fortified base and several large checkpoints. Stalker clans have learned to survive in the neighborhood of the military without causing each other much trouble. There's also a base here for a very mysterious stalker clan called the Enlightenment, about whom little is known. Frequent visitors here are also stalkers of the "Last Day" and "Dawn" clans. Occasionally a few wild gangs from Zaton come to the area, but they try to leave as quickly as possible. Also, here are the decaying remains of several large villages, the dilapidated hulks of a factory, as well as a small military town.</text>

Stalkers quarrel with the gangsters from the clans of "Black Slugs" and others, and they are trying to rip off any passerby, or just slap, so that the weapon does not rust from inactivity. The local fauna survive in their own way too, pecking at whatever comes within sight. The notorious Sidorovich hangs out in the basement, bargains for a bargain basement, so even the seasoned folk and unhatched greens pay him a visit.

Another thing is that it's rather unpleasant to run into mutants in such thickets, because one can easily get stuck in these very groves, saturated with radiation. However, even without help of monsters to disappear easier than a darn thing. There are no signposts at all. Remembering the paths is very difficult. The only thing that can attract here in general, is the abundance of anomalous fields, and hence the artifacts. The base of the Clear Sky clan was also located here. One could drop in for a light and take a break from the road. Discount the hard-earned goods. Renegade Clan and Blackslug thugs also frequented the area. Neutral loners and members of the Last Day clan also occasionally wandered into the area. After the death of the "Clear Sky" faction - the territory of the marsh was occupied by bandits from different factions.</text>

They call themselves diggers. Mad criminals plunder without scruples. They control all vital activities and take the cream off all events. Here their base is in a huge train shed. You'd better either shoot to kill or pretend to be a lover of country chanson. The second option benefits from the opportunity to earn easy money shooting crows. Dusty earnings. In other words, this dump is a very dirty place, and the inhabitants are accordingly. It is not known who heads the local gang now, and there is no one who particularly wants to know. They now sit in their hangar and only rarely conduct raids. Mainly the Black Creeps and Renegades, who never managed to create their own base, run petty errands here.</text>

		<text> Once upon a time, the southern institute building was the base of the "The Debt" faction, who held control of the entire area. Later, the "Duty" found a more suitable place for a base, and the empty complex often stayed in the military during their raids. However,after one of the special services agents blew up there a whole column of "impure" soldiers, they stopped to arrange their resting places there, and as a result the area is now empty and only occasionally occupied by gangsters from the "Renegades" clan, who prefer to hide on the moors only after seeing an army patrol or a large group of stalkers. Central buildings of the complex are under the control of the stalker clan "Last Day". Mutants have scattered here in abundance, but the number of people to shoot them is decreasing. Usually all try to skip through these places in transit to Amber and beyond, rarely stopping to pick up the local wooded hills from the rather large crop of various artifacts.</text>

Perhaps this is due to the fact that the "Dolg" strive to attract as many people as possible into their ranks. A loudspeaker broadcasts propaganda material on a daily basis. In the event of an alarm, the same loudspeaker is used to announce it.

One can search for an entrance to the underground laboratory, but hardly anyone has ever returned from there, and no one knows what's there. There are also many railway tracks leading to a small station. There used to be a mercenary base here, but now they have moved further away closer to the centre. The most common fighters to be found here now are from the elite bandit group "Alpha Dogs". There are also many seasoned lone stalkers who have come for valuable artefacts.

But here you have to regularly rebuff monsters and monoliths, which almost all burst out of the centre of the Zone and seek to expand its possessions. But such hassles more than pay off, you can already find here such artifacts, which are not even the price. Also over the years so many shrewd stalkers have come here that there is every chance to stumble on absolutely exclusive guns, one-of-a-kind items created by skilled craftsmen.

In other words, all the deepest fears, probably left over from the sad times when man was huddled in caves, are awakened here. There are also many abandoned mines and underground tunnels, where all kinds of unfriendly creatures lurk, and the whole forest is their dinner table, a sort of hunting ground. It's not nice to feel like a living ham. There are several underground mines here that lead to who knows where and with who knows what under the ground.

They were experimenting. Earlier on the territory of this small town almost simultaneously penetrated the "Duty" with the "Freedom", but they either shot each other or were killed by the "Monoliths", in general, neither of them now try to wander here.

		<text>From its inception, the Zone began to attract people who infiltrated and were in its territory illegally. This is how stalkerism came about. At first there were not so many of them and they were mostly loners. But with time stalkers began to form groups. At first small groups of five or ten people. Later these groups grew larger and had more definite goals and tasks. Someone managed to establish channels to sell artifacts through the perimeter, and vice versa - channels to deliver weapons and equipment. Thus stalker clans emerged in the Zone. Initially they were few in number, they had no bases, no uniforms of their own. Many small groups perished, others united, others split up. No one knows for sure which factions emerged at the outset. According to one version one of the first to emerge was the Furious clan, the Phantom, and several others. It was only a few years later that the "Duty", "Freedom" and "Monolith" appeared.

Many didn't even make it through the first few months - they were all dead. They were the Heels, the Gong, the Hammer and Sickle, the Clowns. There were exceptions, however. Very serious stalker alliances that existed almost from the very beginning of the Zone, but died for one reason or another. For example, there was a grouping of semi-mutants "Furious". By their principles and beliefs as the Duty, even cooler. The only thing is that they could not survive - mutants, though not completely. But they were almost all killed by stalkers "Insight" and "Chaos". There were also groups - "Raven", "Suicide Squad", "Jerahon", "Children of the Zone". All of them died sometime before 2010. "The Suicide Squad was a clan of escaped convicts. They were wiped out by the pre-existing "Duty" in alliance with the "Seeker". The "Hierakhon" - ordinary sectarians - disintegrated after the death of their spiritual leader. Many of the former Hierahonians later joined the ranks of sinners. "Raven - was once one of the strongest in the Zone, then controlled the entire dump and Agroprom. Wiped itself out. Some leaders wanted to seize as much territory as possible, while others wanted to explore the Zone. As a result the clan split into three independent groups. One of which later became known as "Clear Sky". The other two fought a long time and in the end were wiped out by gangsters from the "Alpha Clans" and "Renegades".

		<text>Group "Enlightenment" emerged back in 2007 and was hardly one of the first stalker clans. Initially their ideology was more reminiscent of svobodovtsy. They were in constant conflict with the 'Fury' clan, until finally the latter was finally wiped out. However this confrontation has undermined the forces of the Enlightenment too, and soon, in order to avoid eventual annihilation, they have called for the disbandment of the clan. However, the clan leaders had agreed, should more favourable conditions arise, to re-establish the clan. Their next epiphany took place about four years later. However, with completely opposite goals. Most members of the new Enlightenment were military stalkers who still had ties to the official military. They set up a base in Northern Kordon under military cover, which helped the clan gain strength. In many ways similar to the 'Duty'. Nothing more is known about them.</text>

		<text>"Clear Sky" - The Explorers of the Zone, a little-known clan lost somewhere in the Swamps. Reliably no one knows what their numbers are, what they do, or what their goals are. But those rare stalkers who have come from the moors talk about guys in sky-blue camouflage. Stalkers are ecologists of a sort. They study the Zone, looking for a way to cure the world of this pestilence. They're neutral towards all factions. Their leaders were Professor Lebedev and Professor Kalancha. The founders were previously involved in O-Consciousness projects. They settled on the peaceful marshes, where they began to do research. In 2011, they had more conflicts with renegades and began to lose ground. That's when they picked up Scar, who had been weakened by the Superdischarge, and decided to enlist his help. He helped them fortify on the marshes and they made their way to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to find the cause of the Superdischarge - the Strelka. They took an active part in the faction war, first crushing the Renegades to the ground and then knocking out the Monolith from Limansk and the Hospital. In doing so, however, they strained their forces. Contrary to Lebedev's calculations, after the cleaners broke through to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, there was another Super Throw and almost the entire group was brainwashed by the project "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.". After that their clan ceased to exist. The fate of most of the leaders is unknown. But what is known for sure is that those Chistonebians who did not take part in the campaign to Chernobyl, left the swamps and went deep into the Zone, where they fortified themselves in the area of the "Jupiter" plant. It was there that their new leader Nazar created the Dawn clan from the remnants of Clear Sky.</text>

The main principle of such an alliance is to stick together, lest they be exterminated one by one. Stalkers who explore the Zone alone. These are the majority, as being part of a group takes up valuable time and thus reduces one's earnings, and some simply tend to be lonely and independent by nature. When the military got cocky and started playing a double game, using the stalkers' lives as bargaining chips, the stalkers lost their temper.

	     <text>"Sin" is one of those groups that is undoubtedly still surrounded by an unsolved mystery. All members of the group are Satanic sectarians. There are rumors that they are cannibals, which have not yet been officially confirmed. "Sin" is a deeply secretive organization and has no shortage of fighters for the reason that it has what it needs to attract new recruits. It is possible that this could be money, artifacts, favors, or anything else that might interest a man who knows exactly what he is getting into. The "Sin" clan is broken up into cells, each of which mind "its" business, without disturbing the others, but at the right moment coming to the aid of their comrades and joining with other "cells". They communicate with each other through ordinary PDAs, but they have certain codes or passwords, through which they determine the identity of interlocutors in the grouping. And the "sinners" can easily be inside any grouping of the Zone. Well, except, of course, the most active cells or those "sinners" who stalker people know by sight. Of course, they are the ones who have to hide themselves completely. They form the shock troops of the sect. And they can render invaluable assistance! "Sinners-spies" can sit at one table with other walkers, go on joint raids, drink and eat together with them and be friends, but no one will know that the other side of his soul is just waiting for the right moment to find the right moment to rob, kill or betray his friend in some way! Moreover, such friendships can last for years! For the "sinner" there are no values, because he considers himself the "orderly of the Zone" or the punisher. If you consider all the known cases of contact with the Sin, it is clear that this is the bane of loners or weakly armed and small groups of stalkers. Although there have also been cases of Sin fighters attacking small bargainers and similarly small bars. Sinners do not harm only those who can fight back. For example, no less badass monoliths, among whom there are many zombified stalkers. Having intimidated the stalkers with bloody rituals and mutilated corpses, the Sin simply pushes them into forming larger teams. And this becomes advantageous primarily to some snitches, as well as military and military intelligence. As a result we get a rather unpleasant picture: "Sin" is profitable for those who want to control the movement of stalkers in the Zone. And that could be anyone from the mercenaries to the Perimeter Security Command! And also peacekeeping forces who are interested in seeing as few stalkers as possible leaving the Zone together with its gifts and secrets! Aside from this serious cover-up, the Sinners do realise that they are an enemy of the stalker community. "Sinners" make themselves huge and rich hiding places, and are always ready to go "underground". They also make their living by exploiting such ugly phenomena as slavery and discovering dangerous areas of the Zone with "picklocks". And it doesn't matter to them whether the "lockpick" moves forward by their naivety or at gunpoint. In order to force a person into an anomaly, such people have very sophisticated means of persuasion. In addition, it is very likely that sinners have intercourse with the "Monolith" - this is indicated by many circumstantial facts.</text>

	<string id="zat_shram_informator_about_zone_about_groups_type_angry_monolith_descr">
	     <text>"Monolith" - A group that looks more like a religious sect. Its members believe that an evolutionary crystal - the Monolith - of unearthly origin lies at the centre of the Zone. Most stalkers despise adherents of the Monolith, considering them insane. Since its formation, the group prevents the advancement of stalkers to the centre of the Zone, explaining this by the latter's ill intentions towards the Monolith. Rumor has it that the Monoliths have a large base somewhere closer to the centre of the Zone, but the exact location knows no one but the members of the group. Before the complete zombification, there was a conflict with the factions of the "Duty" and "Freedom". "We won't let anyone through, any interference by you could result in the ultimate demise of the Monolith. We will open fire on anyone who comes within 30 meters. "This is what one veteran stalker says in the Stalker Bar: "Those who believe in Monolith are lunatics, they scream about it, but no one knows what's at the centre of the Zone. The invisible crystal that fell from the sky... Ha, ha. I think it blew up one of the secret labs. Someone even said they used to work there. But of course you can't bomb the Zone, not only would the radiation blow up all over the world, but the Zone's reaction could blow half of Europe apart." The Monoliths were weirdos before they went completely "off the rails. The clan had sprung up around the end of 2008 and was a small group of loonies. They all talked about aliens, the exclusivity of the Zone, the Alien experiments, and, of course, their beloved Monolith. And they were even believed, despite the fact that there were no living witnesses. Of course, there were enough talkers who said they'd seen Monolith themselves. But who would believe Sanka the Redhead, or Tattletale, who hadn't even been to the Agroprom themselves? Now the Monolith is a top-secret, militarized, state-of-the-art grouping. By far the largest grouping in the Zone. Such a dramatic change with the Monoliths occurred about two years ago, when it became known about the existence of a secret project "O-Consciousness". According to one version stalkers "Monolith" were zombified by "O-Consciousness" by means of one of the psi installations. Thus Consciousness has created a small but very powerful army for its own security. The Monoliths control all areas from Radar, Limansk and further towards Pripyat, the Tesla Zone and ChAES. Even after Strelk eliminated some of the members of the O-Consciousness and stormed the military in Chernobyl and Pripyat, the Monoliths were never destroyed. They soon recovered their positions and became even more powerful than before the assault. Nothing is known about the group's leaders. Only a few of their military and spiritual commanders are mentioned, such as Charon, killed by the Rifleman, as well as the odious Adept, Voland, Guron and the Eruption.</text>

They are a professional in their field, and can quickly take out any stalker and even eliminate a small group of them. They have some of the best weapons and equipment available. Apparently they charge a lot of money and artifacts for their services. Their base used to be in the Wilderness Territory, but after the famous storming of Chernobyl the mercenaries moved it closer to Pripyat. Its location is still a mystery; apparently it is somewhere around the Jupiter plant. According to one version it was originally mercenaries who guarded closed secret laboratories in the Zone before the second explosion. It is even possible that they worked for the O-Consciousness before they were zombified by the Monoliths. Not much is known about the leaders.

"The Renegades were once members of other groups, but having become traitors and outcasts among "their own", they have withdrawn from society to form their own group. The Renegades also include criminals who fled to the Zone and do not want to give their share of the spoils to the bandit bosses, and who do not accept the bandit's 'rules'. "Renegades" are common on the Swamp. They decided to form a group far away from the others, so as not to have any competition and to "stand their ground". At first they even took over almost the entire territory, but, under Lebedev's leadership, Scar and the Clear Sky faction gain the upper hand. They also have well-armed and equipped units in the Redwoods. They prefer not to go any deeper. The Renegades are first dealt a devastating blow by the Clear Sky faction, assisted by Scar. After that, the Renegades have made repeated attempts to finish them off, which have (most likely) turned out to be successful in the end.

If you have a smart waistcoat, you can make a pole and shoot them off one by one on approaches. The method is proven, but sometimes painful. It's a lost cause to hit a moving target of such a small size and to run around on your own.

I will not be able to get a sensible answer, but my curiosity torments me. The scientific consensus is that the dogs have gone blind themselves. That's what they write in all sorts of encyclopaedias. But the old-timers among the stalkers assert that it was the ejection flares that burned out their pupils. Regular dogs like to stare at fireworks. You don't know who to believe. But these cripples can gobble up a lot faster than their sighted relatives. They run in big packs, just like the usual city vagrants. If they get cornered, it's hard to fight back. They'll be gnawed at in one sitting. So it comes out that need to or very smart armor to get, or watch to not be pinned against the wall.</text>

The only way out in this situation is to really show pity and shoot the unfortunate, sort of rabid dogs. Although it's not as easy as it may seem.

In other words, it's best not to prowl the catacombs for no reason, as they're more likely to be found in the dark.

		<text>And this is the business talk. In short, a new stalker clan appeared in our area recently - the "Dawn". Naturally, to establish mutually beneficial relations with them - they pay, we protect - have failed. So we have to teach them a lesson. I have learned that a small group led by one of their commanders is now on the territory of a cement factory on Jupiter. I need that group to cease to exist. After you take them out, don't come to me, report everything to Gawaitz on Janova. Then he'll tell you what to do next.</text>

Your task is to escort me safely to the specified route. Otherwise the Sultan will blow your head off. Once we get to the tunnels, you'll have further instructions.

		<text>No, fraer, it's not all that fast. Thought it was easy. Sultan told me: If you do it right, you'll be fine. Anyway, listen to this. The roach was supposed to get the Sultan a batch of Night Star artifacts. Obviously he didn't, but if you do, you get three Night Star artifacts, take them to the Sultan in person, and then he'll assume you've honored Polecat's debt. Got it, mate?</text>

		<text>What can I tell you, stalker-it sucks so far. Business is profitable, but lately it's getting worse. I don't know why. Something serious has happened in the Zone. Stalkers used to take equipment and weapons more willingly, but now no one conducts any big sorties. All burrowed into holes as if waiting for something...</text>.

		<text>Imagine this. Some say that the monoliths are preparing a major raid into the central regions of the Zone. That's why the loners are moving closer to the south - to the Cordon. That's why there aren't enough customers. And even people who weren't afraid to stay, started disappearing all of a sudden. Nobody knows what to think.

	<string id="zat_b30_owl_stalker_trader_quest_of_mayron_begin_5">
		<text>Yes please. One of the local regulars, Myron, went missing recently. Strange how things turned out. He was on his last hike - not too far - to the Burnt Farm. Myron had been working here for a long time, running small errands. Sometimes with someone in a group, but more often alone. Remarkably, he got along well with both brothers and neutrals. He was a squirrel in a wheel and always kept his ears open. And he was honest...</text>.

		<text>Nothing further to say - he disappeared for a reason. I had one thought that he was obviously someone's butt, but alas, no proof. All I can guess for whom he could work - for the "Duty", "Freedom", and maybe even the "Monolith. It would be nice to know who exactly...</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_b30_owl_stalker_trader_quest_of_mayron_begin_8">
		<text>Are there any people he's been in contact with most often?</text>

	<string id="zat_b30_owl_stalker_trader_quest_of_mayron_begin_9">
		<text>Yeah, Soroka-fucking-white-boy, at first we thought he was a normal stalker, however, it turns out that the last bitch turned out to be. Gonta gave him a death sentence in absentia and I agree with him. Except that Myron wasn't exactly like him. Almost the exact opposite.</text>

	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_begin_1">
		<text>Of course, there is always work to do, and one very serious matter cannot be delayed. But first things first. Recently a very big deal went wrong with our direct involvement. A lot of good people died in the process. And it was all the work of the Dolg. Whether they acted alone or were helped by someone else doesn't matter, what matters is that no matter what kind of "shaky truce" we have with the debtors here, they slap us in the face like that. I can't just let that go. And I intend to take revenge.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_begin_2">
		<text>How do I fit into this whole revenge thing?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_begin_3">
		<text>In the most direct way. You're invisible, and neutral to most stalker factions. You're the best candidate for the role of our executioner. In general, you should eliminate the Drogov, who were directly involved in the massacre of our people. Now my best bloodhound, Anubis, is gathering information on the whereabouts of the Quads we are interested in. You're working together now. He's your spotter- any questions now go to him.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_begin_4">
		<text>Okay. I'll take the job. True, I'm not too fond of getting my hands dirty... Moral compensation should be appropriate.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_begin_5">
		<text>I understand. 50,000 up front now and another 50,000 after the job is done, plus we'll get you some gear. Now go Anubis is waiting for you.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_begin_6">
		<text>No, I won't take it.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_begin_7">
		<text>Whatever, if you change your mind, come in...</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="jup_anubis_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_0">
		<text>So you're the man Loki hired to be the punisher of debtors.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_1">
		<text>Yes, that's me. Let's skip all the formalities and get straight to business, shall we?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_2">
		<text>Whatever. Anyway, the theme so far is this. In the recent massacre at the eastern tunnels on the debtors' side, two combat quads were primarily involved. A scouting quad, and a few more from extra cover. My job is to locate them, yours is to go to them and destroy them.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_3">
		<text>And the location of which quads do you now know?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_anubis_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_4">
		<text>Quad of their field commander Haran- now near Janov. I think you can already go to give him my regards.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_5">
		<text>And what about the others. Do you have the information?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_6">
		<text>Warg, the Debt infiltrator - who basically sniffed out our plans and turned us in - is unknown at this point, we'll probably have to go to Zaton for him. About Shaitan, that vile creature, who has killed most of our guys, I will find out very soon. As for the scouting quad, that's easy, you just have to wait for the right moment. Alright, what are you standing around for - go kill Haran, he deserves it.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_7">
		<text>I'll be there soon.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="jup_anubis2_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_0">
		<text>So, did Haran get what he deserved?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis2_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_1">
		<text>Yes, he and his men are dead. And who else was brought here?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis2_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_2">
		<text>This is Goose Bitch. Snitch. He ratted us out to the dolgovs. He's the one who tipped off the Debt agent about our secret base. And he also negotiated with Shaitan about attacking it.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis2_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_3">
		<text>So why haven't you shot him yet?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis2_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_4">
		<text>Gusak knows a lot. I've already questioned him on matters of interest to me, now it's your turn. Find out where Shaitan is now. Then go there and kill him.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis2_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_5">

		<text>I'm going to get killed anyway... although the hell with them all....hm...hmmm... "Duty", "Freedom", may the Zone devour you all...and you along with them...

		<text>As I understand it - Shaitan is done. Nice work. I haven't been idle either,</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis3_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_1">
		<text>With Shaitan, it was a bit of a struggle. His fighters were too strong. Yeah, by the way-did you find out where to find those spies from the mask show?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_anubis3_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_2">
		<text>Yes, they're not far from here. Waiting for their fakers now. Found out they're doing some business with the scientists there. One of them's dressed as a scientist, by the way. But he's expendable, too. Hurry up, or they might run away.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis3_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_3">

    </string>
	<string id="jup_anubis3_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_first_talking_4">

		<text>Great news. Here you go, as I promised. The second part of your payment.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_end_talking_2">

    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_end_talking_3">
		<text>I sent him to the Zaton. There's one other person left who hasn't been punished. It is Varg. Anubis must find him.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_the_revange_of_freedom_end_talking_4">
		<text>I think he'll do well.</text>

	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_first_talking_00">
	    <text>Have you got a task for me?</text>.
	</string>	
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_first_talking_0">
		<text>It's very good of you to drop in on me now. There's a case you can't refuse.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_first_talking_1">
		<text>Really? So what am I supposed to do with it? Exactly how much?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_first_talking_2">
		<text>A lot, my friend, a lot. Here's the deal: we've recently received a very serious order from some seriously rich people from the big earth. They wanted a rare and urgent artifact, the Violin. Immediately they offered a double price, and I found it necessary to agree.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_first_talking_3">
		<text>Fine, and I take it you're suggesting I'm the one doing the searching? Wouldn't one of the ordinary stalkers do it better?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_first_talking_4">
		<text>Mayor, you're right on point. Don't get too excited, twenty-five percent of the deal. That's about fifty thousand, no less. How - a convincing argument, to crawl on his belly with a detector between anomalies?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_first_talking_5">
		<text>Weighty, but can you at least give me a clue as to where this artifact can be found?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_first_talking_6">
		<text>Eh, that's up to you, my friend. The violin, if memory serves me correctly, has only been found a couple of times. So talk to Ozersky about it. He's an expert on artefacts among scientists. He might be able to tell us something.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_first_talking_7">
		<text>A nice perspective. Okay, if I find something, I'll be sure to let you know...</text>.
    </string>
    
    <string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_ozerskiy_talking_0">
		<text>Do you know anything about the artifact Skripka?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_ozerskiy_talking_1">
		<text>Of course. This is a very rare and expensive artefact. In appearance, it is a large glowing orb. During all time only five samples of this artifact were found. However, we are not interested in such things.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_ozerskiy_talking_2">
		<text>And tell us why scientists are not particularly interested in this artefact</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_ozerskiy_talking_3">
		<text>The point is that the violin has purely aesthetic value - the artefact hangs half a metre above any surface and shimmers brightly in all the colours of the rainbow. In addition, the slightest breeze produces a melodious ringing in different tones. It is not radioactive, but it does not have any other useful properties. That is why mainly collectors with a lot of money are interested in it. As the value of the violin is estimated at around half a million.</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_ozerskiy_talking_4">
		<text>And can you tell me where I can track her down?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_ozerskiy_talking_5">
		<text>I can say for sure that the maternal anomaly in the violin is called Echo. But this anomaly is even rarer than the artifact itself. However, the violin can sometimes be found near psi zones. Though, I think some experienced stalker can tell you about it in more detail. Beard on Skadovsk, for example. Well, he certainly specializes in artifacts, and even if I remember correctly, he once found a similar thing.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_ozerskiy_talking_6">
		<text>Thank you very much.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_ozerskiy_talking_7">
		<text>Good luck.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_boroda_talking_0">
		<text>Listen Beard, here's the thing, can you tell me where I can find the artifact Skripka in the area?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_boroda_talking_1">
		<text>Huh. What do you need it for, if it's not a secret?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_boroda_talking_2">
		<text>It's just an order and I have to complete it.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_boroda_talking_3">
		<text>Okay, you don't want to talk, don't do it. Fiddler's only been caught once on Zaton. That was back when I wasn't behind a bar, but out exploring the Zone. I managed to find it near the Scab anomaly, where the psi field is crazy-you know that. So I'd encourage you to look in places where there's a lot of psi activity. Speaking of which, don't write off the Brainiac anomaly either. I think you'll have to go there as well.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_boroda_talking_4">
		<text>Thank you, friend-helpful.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_boroda_talking_5">
		<text>You're welcome. Just don't forget - you need a good detector to find it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_second_talking_0">
		<text>There, I got the artifact Skripka. It wasn't easy to do. So, I'm counting on a good reward.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_second_talking_1">
		<text>Fairly, here's your share. I can see that you have something to say.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_second_talking_2">
		<text>Yes, Loki. When I was climbing through the anomalies with the detector for your artifact, I was attacked by two mercenaries in libertarian uniforms. Anything you want to tell me about that?</text>
    </string>  
    <string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_second_talking_3">
		<text>What's the story here - I had to check something, and then this order for a lot of money. You know yourself, that now snitches like pseudo-snitches. I'm just spreading the word to the general public. Anubis, by the way, your buddy had this case under his control. So, don't mind me, but we found another snitch with your help.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_loki_quest_artefact_skripka_second_talking_4">

	<string id="zat_bandit_volk1_for_vobla_quest_first_talking_12">
		<text>In short, a small group of stalkers came to Zaton. Their leader, nicknamed Phantom, was my deputy on Cordon. That's the problem. They haven't reached Skadovsk yet, and they're not supposed to. I don't need Phantom blabbing about my past here.</text>

		<text>Do you guess, though. Kill the Phantom and you'll be happy. By the way, I heard that he carries some valuable information from the south of the Zone. You can have it for yourself and give it to the informer, it will go to you as a payment for your work. For me it is important that the Phantom is gone forever.</text>

		<text>Zone bro, it's probably all about it. All I know is that after Strelok once knocked out the second Incinerator Wolf was somewhere on the Militarium. The Phantom took his place at the rookie camp. What might have happened next - only the black stalker knows.</text>

		<text>All right. Go ahead and shoot. After that, even if you manage to get out of "Skadovsk" alive, which I highly doubt, you will be so hunted - half of the Zone will be after you.

    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_6">
		<text>Command's plans for you have been slightly revised. Twenty-four hours ago, very interesting, hitherto unknown information was received at headquarters. And it has been decided to verify them through you.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_7">
		<text>What information, if not a secret?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_8">
		<text>Some details have become known about who caused the second explosion and created the new Exclusion Zone. Apparently it was the result of an experiment being conducted here in the Zone. And it's not connected with any aliens, it's all people's fault.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_9">
		<text>It's interesting to hear that, so what do you think it could have been?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_10">
		<text>Commanders learned that for nearly twenty years immediately after the first disaster, a number of secret defense laboratories had sprung up around Chernobyl, undertaking a variety of developments</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_11">
		<text>And whose labs were these?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_12">
		<text>Before the collapse of the Union it was ours, but then in the nineties the funding came from abroad. We do not know who was involved in this. All we know is that some of these laboratories were engaged in various kinds of research in the field of genetics, including research on humans. Others were developing new kinds of weapons based on new physical principles. However, their main project was to conduct experiments on the noosphere of the Earth. And it is the opinion of higher authorities that it was the failure or otherwise of an experiment on the noosphere that caused the emergence of the Zone.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_13">
		<text>What exactly would my task be?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_14">
		<text>After the second explosion, some of the laboratories ceased to function, but work continued in others. The report mentioned something about the O-Consciousness project and its impact on the Zone. The command set out to find out what the O-Consciousness project really is.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_15">
		<text>What kind of information do you want?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_16">
		<text>First of all, we need to collect detailed information on all the laboratories that existed in the Zone. This will allow our analysts to determine what role Project O-Consciousness played in all of this. You will receive further instructions later, after you have gathered all the information about the secret labs under the index "X".</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_17">
		<text>How many of these labs are there in total?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_18">
		<text>I don't know exactly. Supposedly about ten, but you don't have to track down every one of them and get in there. You'll just have to get some information or papers about the X-lab. I suggest you talk to the informant first, perhaps he already knows something about this.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_19">
		<text>Okay, I get it.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_lze_sbu_authorities_talking_20">
		<text>By the way, when you gather all the information let the informer know - then he will tell you what to do. Good luck Major.</text>

		<text>Same to you.</text>
    </string>

		<text>Yes, so what?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_lze_agent_quest_second_talking_2">
		<text>Do you know anything about the O-Consciousness project?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_lze_agent_quest_second_talking_3">
		<text>That's what you're talking about straight away. To be honest no one knows anything about it. And it's not even a project, but something more. Perhaps the main mystery of the Zone. But rumor has it that it's just a bunch of shifty scientists who worked at Chernobyl and were destroyed by a gunman during his second trip to the Zone. But to be honest, I don't really believe it.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_lze_agent_quest_second_talking_4">
		<text>Why is that?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_lze_agent_quest_second_talking_5">
		<text>No one knows if they even existed. Eh, I wish I could get my memory back, they probably came up before two years ago, maybe I'd know more. And Shooter, after he's gone into the abyss. There's no confirmation. The only clue is about the X-labs, but there's not much of that either. And I take it you're going to have to look into it?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_lze_agent_quest_second_talking_6">
		<text>Yes, you're right. And what do you know about the X-labs?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_lze_agent_quest_second_talking_7">
		<text>Well, there's something. A total of ten complexes marked with the index X are known for sure. Это Х1,Х2,Х6,Х7,Х8,Х9,Х10,Х12,Х16,Х18. I have even been to some of them, some of them are even located nearby. And I've got some information about the X9 lab. Here - I think they will be useful to you.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_lze_agent_quest_second_talking_8">
		<text>Thank you, I think we'll get back to you and I'll do the rest of the research.</text>

		<text>what is it?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_first_talking_3">
		<text>Yes by the fact that I have nothing to answer you. I have no name, no past, nothing. Just the Zone.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_first_talking_4">
		<text>What happened?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_first_talking_5">
		<text>Two years ago, sometime shortly before Shooter made his second trek to Chernobyl, I lost my memory. When I woke up, I was in the base of the stalker clan "Liberty" - it's on the Militarium. A clever deputy of the clan leader, Svoboda, said that they found me immediately after the ejection, not far from the barrier. I had nothing on me, no weapons, no PDA, and no gear. None of them knew whether I was caught in the ejection or whether I had been dragged and dumped near the Freedom checkpoint. The only thing I managed to find a strange tattoo on my arm "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", but what it could mean no one knew. The fact is that I survived, but I remember absolutely nothing about my past life.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_first_talking_6">
		<text>Yeah, it's sad, but how could you become an Informant - after all, you had to know the Zone like the back of your hand to do so. I think so.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_first_talking_7">
		<text>A week or so after I came to my senses Smarty decided to check how much of my old reflexes might still be in me. If I was a stalker, at the very least I should have known about weapons. When I was given a simple Kalashnikov, I could easily assemble and disassemble it with my eyes closed, and I knew almost everything about its combat parameters. The knowledge just sort of popped out of my head. It was the same with the other weapons. Then I was allowed to use a few magazines as a drill. I showed the kind of shooting that no freedom fighter had ever done before. After another week, Umnik included me in his expedition to Limansk. When we left the base in the vastness of the Zone, I could easily identify any anomaly that we came across on the way. Then Smartypants informed me that I had enlisted in the ranks of Freedom. But I didn't want that. During the expedition in the city we were attacked by a large monolithic force. We managed to fight back and it was largely due to my actions. There were only three survivors: myself, Umnik and his clanmate, Loki. I told them I had to leave, and they grudgingly let me do so. After that, I wandered the Zone for another year, recovering scraps of memory, looking for new information, and so on. Eventually I became an Informant and came here to Zaton. But to this day I could not find even the slightest shred of information about who I am.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_first_talking_8">
		<text>I'd really like to help you with this quest, but I don't think it would be easy. But it makes sense to try.</text>

		<text>Hello Coolibin, I have a quick question for you.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_1">
		<text>Come on, ask! Anything I can do to help.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_2">
		<text>I know that you used to be a member of the Clear Sky clan, and I also happen to know a guy named Scar who once helped your faction. Could you tell me about him?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_3">
		<text>What are you all up to with this "Clear Sky", and if I wore a monolithic suit, you'd think I was an ex-fanatic. I'll have to do it next time.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_4">
		<text>So you tell me about Scar.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_5">
		<text>What to tell about him. He was a mercenary. He appeared not long before Shram went to ChAES for the first time. Scar was contracted to lead a group of scientists to our base. But he got caught in a spontaneous ejection and didn't lead anyone to it. No one knew how he survived, not even Lebedev. After that, he offered Scar a new contract. The first: to help the group rebound from the marauder clan "Renegades", and secondly, to find and destroy the shooter, lest he did what else he did.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_6">
		<text>And how do you think he could have survived that famous blowout that destroyed your faction at Chernobyl?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_7">
		<text>You never know. He was a tough son of a bitch, but as for luck, I don't know. I heard on the radio the last conversation with Lebedev and others - such an asshole was going on there. Even if Scar was not killed by the ejection, the monoliths infesting Chernobyl probably shot him.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_8">
		<text>But the Shooter survived, why couldn't Shram?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_9">
		<text>Listen, go to Chernobyl and ask those who dwell there: whether there was a dude named Scar who came to your place two years ago with the Clean Sky stormtroopers just to shoot ducks - you haven't seen him, have you? You realize you're talking nonsense and distracting from your work.</text>
    </string>.

		<text>All right, don't get too boisterous. Thanks for that. One last question-you said I wasn't the only one who asked you about Clear Skies?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_11">
		<text>Yeah, that freedom fighter came here the other day - I think his name is Anubis. He was asking about the same thing, only he didn't mention Scar. He was more concerned about Lebedev. Well, I told him what I knew in general.</text>

	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_novikov_talking_12">

    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_shustriy_talking_3">
		<text>Shram, Shram something comes to mind. So this one's from The Last Day, and I remember! There was such a man. Back in the days when I was Clear Sky.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_shustriy_talking_4">
		<text>something more you can say?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_shustriy_talking_5">
		<text>Yeah, well, he came to us from the side of Agroprom. He was blown away by the ejection, I remember I was helping him with a new PDA to deal with. That was a hell of a blow too. But he was a hell of a shooter, though. Took all the renegades out of the swamps. And then he went after the shooter to Chernobyl, and perished, along with Lebedev and others.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_shustriy_talking_6">
		<text>Is he really gone? What if he survived? Have you met anyone you know who looks like him?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_shustriy_talking_7">
		<text>Yeah, I think our Informer looks a bit like him, I'm just not sure. Trying to talk to him on this subject - so he almost threw me off the ship for hime. Crazy as hell, I'm with him and so it's not much of a deal.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_shustriy_talking_8">
		<text>I have one lead on this. Found a couple of curious documents in Pripyat recently. I think Shrum is our informant.</text>

		<text>Doing fine, except wait, what did you call me?</text>
    </string>

		<text>Shram.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_second_talking_3">
		<text>So you managed to dig up my past after all. Wait, Scar, am I really Scar?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_second_talking_4">
		<text>Yes. You're the one who once got involved with the Clear Skies faction. Then tried to kill Strelok, participated in the faction war and did a lot of other things. You have managed to be identified by Winky and Garin - the only survivors of the Clear Sky representatives with whom you once dealt.</text>.

		<text>Please- here's a secret instruction for one of the former monolith leaders to Haron. It was compiled by one of the O-Consciousness leaders, Grechet. It says that you and Shooter were thrown back into the Zone after being processed. Apparently you became S.T.A.L.K.E.R. project test subjects. Except that Shooter was programmed to kill himself, and he went and interrupted the "O-Consciousness". So what was done to you then, because in the two years since you were dropped from the death truck on the Militar, nothing else unusual has happened to you.</text>

	<string id="zat_shram_about_himself_quest_second_talking_7">

	<string id="jup_novikov_about_unique_grenade_quest_first_talking_5">
		<text>Briefly, there is such an artifact - "Eye", maybe heard about it, but if not, I tell you. Extraordinarily rare and expensive. I am interested in it exclusively due to its wonderful feature - to record events happening around itself. It's like a natural video camera. I would like to learn more about it.</text>

	<string id="jup_novikov_about_unique_grenade_quest_first_talking_6">

		<text>You'd better ask Garik about that, friend - he's our resident artifact finder. But one thing I can tell you that here in the vicinity you will not find it, so be prepared to go to Pripyat.</text>

	<string id="jup_novikov_about_unique_grenade_quest_first_talking_8">

		<text>You see, the city is very turbulent right now and Garik is unlikely to go anywhere but the Laundromat, where the military have fortified themselves. I can tell that Garik once dragged such an artifact from Pripyat, after that he spent a week coming out, saying, he's suffered so much, that no money will go to Pripyat for the artifacts no more.</text>

    </string>.
	<string id="jup_novikov_about_unique_grenade_quest_garik_talking_3">
		<text>Yeah, I remember that time. Barely got out of that asshole alive. The monoliths were chasing me all over town. Never went to Pripyat for artifacts again. I'll just drive people back and forth. And the Oak is a very rare artifact indeed. I found it somewhere near a school or a kindergarten, I don't remember exactly. Then such a palm began that I do not soorientatsii.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_novikov_about_unique_grenade_quest_garik_talking_4">
		<text>And what is the artifact itself?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_novikov_about_unique_grenade_quest_garik_talking_5">
		<text>Yeah, I don't think you'll mistake him for anything. A blue-green ball with a dark cloudy centre. If you look into it, you can see a lot of interesting things. But remember, Oko is a rare thing, and if you find one, you're out of luck, because it might be months before another eye miracle appears. At least, I know that besides me this artifact was found only ten times, and only in Pripyat. The last time Prigorshnya dug out in a cinema, but there now the Monolith support base and it is unlikely they will leave lying around such a junk just like that, should it appear there again. So it's better to look where I said</text>.

		<text>This is the thing, Major-some very big scientists from the big earth are now interested in a few "very small" but insanely expensive artefacts. Why they want them, I do not know, but the scientists offer a lot.</text>

    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_5">
		<text>What a secret now. The artifacts are called "Walnut" and "Drill". I don't think you've ever encountered them, so those names don't really mean anything to you.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_6">

    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_8">
		<text>Come on, tell me more</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_9">
		<text>So there's this stalker, Lemur is his name. Earlier, back when I myself was a stalker, this Lemur was just a vagabond from Southern Cordon - nowhere beyond the Salvka never looked, nothing more serious than the Stone Flower did not find, guns cooler than a "Kalash" in his hands. However, about a year ago he was very lucky to meet a geologist. Then the two of them set off on a dangerous trip through half the Zone. But I do not know how it ended, I know for a fact that Lemur was no longer a green loser and shuffled off into the depths of the Zone. They say that he found one of the artifacts of interest to us - Nut. And then, as I was told - Lemur was known to one now no less legendary stalker named Enoch - he told Lemur about the artifact Drill. I do not know whether he found Drill after that, but the main thing is that the stalker knows about both artifacts.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_10">
		<text>Okay, so where am I supposed to find this Lemur?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_11">
		<text>You don't have to look for anyone anymore. He came to Janow the day before yesterday to rest and replenish supplies. I got a message from Hawaiian just yesterday. He says that Lemur has told him that he wants to join any grouping, but in the last go almost died for nothing - like, he was too shy to continue to walk alone. So, go to Janov and talk to Lemur there. After that, look for artifacts and don't come back without them. I'll pay you ten percent of the total.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_12">
		<text>OK, I'm on my way.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_13">
		<text>That's great.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_14">
		<text>Maybe I'll get to it later.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_first_talking_15">
		<text>As you know.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_lemur_talking_00">
		<text>Salaam Aleikum, brother</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_lemur_talking_0">
		<text>Same to you, Lemur. By the way, I've come to you on a case. From Beard.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_lemur_talking_1">
		<text>How's that bearded bartender doing over there? Still sitting on "Skadovsk"?</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_lemur_talking_2">
		<text>Yeah, where will he go from there. Anyway, I need your help. The beard has ordered me to find two rare artifacts, the Nut and the Drill. And he said you might know where to find them.</text>
    </string>.	
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_lemur_talking_3">
		<text>Anyways, I can only give a rough tip. As for Peanut, I once found him by accident on the Militar, while crawling on the belly over the radioactive hills so as not to run into monoliths. Here, however, I'm not sure that the artifact can appear at all, although there is an opinion that it is more likely to occur in places with elevated radiation backgrounds. Therefore it is more likely to look in Kopacz, where there is always a lot of radiation. As for the Drill, Enoch told me that an acquaintance of his, Corkscrew, had found such an artifact. But now Corkscrew is dead and would hardly tell me how he could be so lucky. Enoch says only that Stopor hid his stuff in the overpass Pripyat-1. When he and Inok there came mutants attacked them, Stopor ditched a partner, but managed to grab the artifacts. However, he didn't get far and perished with his loot. Where is unknown, but I know for a fact that he did not get out of the overpass. And after about half a year one of the freedom fighters, Ares, it seems, pulled out one such artifact. No one's found the other one yet. Most likely it is still there somewhere.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_lemur_talking_4">
		<text>Thank you very much, I think we need to comb through the places you mentioned. Yeah, by the way you're from the south now, what's the news there?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_lemur_talking_5">
		<text>I came from the Redwoods, passing through Limansk on the way. Yes, it's hotter there than ever. It's almost impossible to get through the town: there's damn sinners everywhere, and where do these fanatics come from? The monoliths are too many to handle, and then there's the freaks. And what they're doing there in Limansk, these lunatics have never wandered beyond the Agroprom. And in the Red Forest is something completely crap going on - all the mutants burrowed into the holes, before there was no room for them, but now is the cleanest place in the area. However, anomalous fields have grown, maybe the Zone wants to close the sector again for conservation - maybe it's for the best. Oh yes, I forgot - the forester, by the way, also left his tower. They say that the southern graves went, but why do not know.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_boroda_about_unique_artefact_quest_lemur_talking_6">

    </string>	
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_0">
		<text>Professor, I wanted to ask you about a unique lifeform detector.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_1">
		<text>Yes, of course, ask. What are you interested?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_2">
		<text>Can a similar device be built in your lab?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_3">
		<text>Well, in general we already have similar developments. But only at early stages. There is a prototype device capable of detecting only warm-blooded human organisms.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_4">
		<text>No, that one doesn't suit me. I wanted the device to be versatile, able to detect mutants as well. Moreover, we need him to distinguish them.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_5">
		<text>Hmm, the mutated life forms are of course very different, but in order to isolate these differences both in the spectral range and in the various frequency ranges by a recognisable device would require a lot of experimentation and a number of measurements. In addition, I think it would be even better to combine the capabilities of bioradar with a standard anomaly detector.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_6">
		<text>You mean to say that it is theoretically possible to create a universal scanner of both biological life forms and physical anomalous zones?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_7">
		<text>Yes, I'm sure we can make it happen. Only we will need a lot of research material for all the tweaks.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_8">
		<text>I am willing to help you as much as I can</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_9">
		<text>Okay, then you'll need to collect some biological material first. We need you to bring some mutant body parts.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_10">
		<text>Which mutants and how many?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_11">
		<text>Dog tails and boar hooves are always in abundance. We will only need samples from those mutants that are either less common or also those that stalkers prefer to stay away from. So you should bring us ten snork feet, five bloodsucker tentacles, three burer arms, and one controller arm each, one chimera claw, and one psedogiant eye.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_12">

    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_13">

    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_14">

    </string>
	<string id="jup_german_about_biodetector_quest_1_first_talking_15">

	<string id="jup_novikov_about_biodetector_quest_3_first_talking_3">
		<text>Help, you say. You'll have to run through some anomalies, so I advise you to change your costume for a proper one. Sorry about that, but I can fit one in for you, it's a bit ragged and the blood isn't completely clean. Herman wrote it off, not taken from a corpse, do not worry.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_novikov_about_biodetector_quest_3_first_talking_4">
		<text>You're a shabby joker, but come on, so what exactly do I have to do?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_novikov_about_biodetector_quest_3_first_talking_5">
		<text>It's simple. About a week ago, our freelance workers, led by Topol, set up special scanners at some significant anomalies on Zaton. Now, I need you to run through them and collect those scanners along with the recorded information. This data will help me a lot in fine-tuning the prototype device in the final phase.</text>

		<text>All, I've collected all the scanners.</text>

	<string id="jup_novikov_about_biodetector_quest_3_second_talking_1">
		<text>Good, now I can set up your radar, so just wait a bit. Just some info from the readings.....A, thought so....Hmmm, maybe.... No - no change.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_novikov_about_biodetector_quest_3_second_talking_2">
		<text>What? Is something wrong? Why don't you do some more digging, and I'll mind my own business and come back later?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_novikov_about_biodetector_quest_3_second_talking_3">
		<text>No, I'm done, it's just that the data you brought fully confirmed the one we already had. Consider that you ran for nothing. Whatever. Well, there you go - it's for your efforts, and I also give you your long-awaited bioradar.</text>

		<text>It's very good that you came Major, we have a very serious problem here. And I think you can help us to solve it.</text>

	<string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_first_talking_3">
		<text>So here's what happened the other day: I got an alarming message from a stalker, saying that he recently came across a group of strange mutants, they look like ordinary blind dogs, only much more dangerous and stronger. I do not know what kind of dogs there, but one of our hunters, his name is Zubr, does not agree with me. But one of our hunters, his name is Zubr, he disagreed with me. He said, we should check him - maybe the guy is not lying, then we may miss new subspecies of mutants, what the fuck hunters we are then.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_first_talking_4">
		<text>What happened next?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_first_talking_5">
		<text>Yes, Zubr was probably right and there really was something serious going on there. He had checked in with me a few hours ago and threw me the approximate coordinates of their lair. Then I heard gunfire on the radio and the connection went dead. But Bison's PDA is still active, so it doesn't look like he's dead. I want you to go to the area Zubr and destroy all the mutants that you find there, and I am also interested in the fate of the hunter.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_first_talking_6">
		<text>Okay, I'll do it properly, just why don't you want to catch at least one specimen of this creature?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_first_talking_7">
		<text>There's no time for that yet. There's more important things to worry about than mutants--something big might happen here soon, maybe having to defend Skadovsk against mercenaries.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_second_talking_0">
		<text>I've dealt with those mutants and found Bison, unfortunately he's dead - here's his PDA.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_second_talking_1">
		<text>Shit, I knew it. Why didn't I believe him? They missed a new subspecies of dog, too. At least what they're all about.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_second_talking_2">
		<text>In general, mutants are like mutants. Most likely they originated from the evolution of blind dogs - in many ways they were similar. Attacking tactics are identical, and they had to run after them.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_second_talking_3">
		<text>Good thing that it was resolved at least that way, here-you deserve a reward and also, need to report these dogs Beastmaster, I think he will be interested to hear about them, in addition, he said that they have on Janova rumors about some more serious creatures than these. So don't wait too long to visit.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_second_talking_4">
		<text>I'll be sure to talk to the Beastmaster as soon as I'm on Janova. Oh, by the way, you talked about a possible mercenary assault on Skadovsk. Is it true?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_gonta_about_cerber_quest_second_talking_5">
		<text>No, the information has not been confirmed. Someone has put out a deceit. But as soon as they find this joker, they'll let him walk in the chowder, believe me.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_first_talking_0">

    </string>
    <string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_first_talking_2">
		<text>Voznik a new subspecies of blind dogs. It has not yet been given an official name. True, one hunter who died first found them to be similar to cerberas. I've seen them too, and even shot them.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_first_talking_3">
		<text>And blind dogs are a new subspecies. Where the Zone is going. Okay, we'll have to deal with that later. Right now, we've got some much bigger new problems here.</text>

		<text>What's up?</text>.
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_first_talking_5">
		<text>There's a new mutant as well. Some have already dubbed it a psevdosnork, though the resemblance to the snork is only in its behavioural pattern. These creatures are much stronger and harder to kill. Several have already died. To get together and hit their lairs is not yet possible for some reason.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_first_talking_6">
		<text>And what are these reasons?</text>.
    </string>
    <string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_first_talking_7">
		<text>These critters are only active at night, and places where there have been recorded cases of their attacks on stalkers, and without these critters are dangerous even during the day. At nighttime it is unlikely that anyone will go there, even for a lot of money.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_first_talking_8">

		<text>Thirty thousand, cash immediately.</text>

    <string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_first_1_talking_1">
		<text>So you first have to go to the tunnels near the Jupiter, where you killed the Burer, then to the Jupiter factory - there are more of them.</text>

	<string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_second_talking_3">
		<text>What makes you think they'd be so interested? You think Herman and Ozersky have nothing better to do right now? They are busy working on some new setup, don't know which one.</text>

    </string>
	<string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_second_talking_5">
		<text>I have a source of my own, a reliable one. He says that our scientists signed a contract with a group, but for what - no one knows.</text>.

	<string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_second_talking_6">

    </string>.
	<string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_second_talking_7">
		<text>Hmmm, then why, when I talked about possible mutant problems they only brushed it off. As if they knew what. Creature activity is really hot right now-you've seen that yourself plus there's a whole new species on the rise.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_zveroboy_about_psevdosnork_quest_second_talking_8">
		<text>All right Zveroboy, I think you're too suspicious - the main thing is that we got rid of the pseudo-snorks, and the rest will sort itself out somehow. True, about the scientists' contract, I'll take that under advisement. Maybe I'll learn something.</text>

    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_1">
		<text>In essence, yes. Once upon a time, most members of Dawn were indeed Clear Sky, but we've accounted for most of the mistakes made by the previous leadership, and I can say that in many ways we are now different from Clear Sky.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_2">
		<text>What kind of errors?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_3">
		<text>First and foremost it's about the combat training of the fighters and the uniforms and weapons used. Maybe an AKSU and MP-5 would do for the marshes, but it will not do for the centre here. And our ideology is a little different now. Now we are more like the "duty".</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_4">
		<text>Are you aware of exactly how the majority of the Clear Sky clan died?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_5">
		<text>Unfortunately, I don't have the exact details. When Lebedev and Kalancha followed the mercenary on the road through Limansk to the ChAES, I knew it would end badly. Until then no group had ever got so close to the centre of the Zone, with the exception of the Monoliths, who were there. Initially, this adventure Lebedev was doomed to fail. We were not strong enough to try to climb the Chernobyl alone. There were only thirty of us left at the base. Garin kept in touch with Lebedev till the end - till the ejection.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_6">
		<text>And then what happened?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_7">
		<text>As soon as it became clear that everyone who went to Chernobyl was dead-we made the decision to leave the swamps. Maraders seemed to be waiting for this moment, attacking us when we left the base-right on the Fisherman's Farm. We fought back by miracle, though they managed to split us into two small squads. Garin and I led the one which now formed the backbone of the Dawn. We broke through the pumping station on secret paths, managed to bypass all the bandits' camps and came to the road to the Agroprom. You could count ourselves lucky. The second squad led Suslov to the Cordon. They tried to sneak past the Old Church, but they were spotted. Only five men survived, among them Shisty and Cold. I heard that Shyster had survived on Zaton, but I do not know where Kholod and the others are. Suslov with the majority of soldiers were killed near Southern Farm - they were shot at point-blank range by machine guns - and where did the bandits get them from?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_8">.
		<text>Sadly, you probably wanted to know what really happened at the Chernobyl plant during that release, didn't you</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_9">
		<text>How will you know now? All of us who were there died, except perhaps the Rifleman, but where did he go after his second quest? Nothing is known about Scar, apparently he shared the fate of the purebreds, although there is no evidence of that. The only option is to track down the shooter and ask him about the details of those days.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_first_talking_10">

		<text>What do you know about the Clear Skies faction?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_strelok_about_clear_sky_quest_talking_3">
		<text>Ah, about those winged ones, yes, not much. The main thing is that once tried to kill me, even hired a professional mercenary, but it did not work, although they disrupted my plans and through their fault, I lost my memory then. Now they're all gone, only a few survived and founded a new clan - I think they call them "Dawn" now.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="pri_strelok_about_clear_sky_quest_talking_4">
		<text>What can you tell me about that day at Chernobyl when the grouping was destroyed?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_strelok_about_clear_sky_quest_talking_5">
		<text>I don't really remember anything. Mercenary of them, then nearly killed me, and then the cast went off and that's it - a failure for the year. True now I was able to restore some of the details of what happened.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_strelok_about_clear_sky_quest_talking_6">
		<text>I'm listening to you carefully.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_strelok_about_clear_sky_quest_talking_7">
		<text>It has come to my attention that most likely the leaders of the Clear Sky clan were not killed that day, but just as they were then caught as guinea pigs in yet another "O-Consciousness" experiment. It seems to be a project called "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.". What exactly is his essence I still do not know, but I know that it is far from over. And what may result from it also no one knows.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_strelok_about_clear_sky_quest_talking_8">
		<text>Do you know anything more specific about Lebedev and Kalancha?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_strelok_about_clear_sky_quest_talking_9">
		<text>There was one clue, only it needs checking. You know the lab under Pripyat? Maybe that's where O-Consciousness was conducting the blackout phase of the project, except all traces of it have probably been destroyed, but I'd check it out if I were you. When I was making my way through Pripyat last time, I killed one of the monolith leader Charon on my way to Chernobyl. Before that I saw him with a large detachment of his men coming out of the Yubileynoye BWC, under which the laboratory is located. But he did not have any documents with him. Perhaps some of them he hid in "Jubilee", and some he left in the lab, or maybe not, so I advise you to comb the area, and see if you can find a clue.</text>

	<string id="pri_strelok_about_clear_sky_quest_talking_10">
		<text>Thank you for your help, I will do so.</text>

	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_0">
		<text>I've managed to clear up a few things.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_1">
		<text>Have you tracked down Shooter?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_2">
		<text> Not only that, but here's a look at Lebedev and Kalancha's PDA and one very interesting document on the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. project</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_3">
		<text>Wow, where did you dig them up, and what's the project, I've never heard of it.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_4">
		<text>Yes, me too, but it's the whole point of what's going on, and the PDAs were in the cache, in Pripyat.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_5">
		<text>And what comes out - Lebedev and Kalancha could have survived and become participants in the project, but how does that, it turns out...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_6">
		<text>Not only Lebedev, but also Scar. I have a clue as to where he is now, but here's Lebedev. That's a mystery I can't solve yet.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_7">
		<text>But I think we can now tackle this issue together as soon as more details become known. Here - take this to work. Now it would be very helpful to track down Scar - maybe he can clear something up. I also learned the other day about Cold, the former bartender of the Clear Sky clan. He was killed along with a group of free-walkers in Pripyat near the school about a month ago. He was there on behalf of Sidorovich. It also became known that his group managed to get some information about the X-lab. It is not known where this information disappeared to. It is possible that shortly before his death, Cold managed to dump something in the stash, or maybe not. If you're in the area, see what you can find.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_8">
		<text>I'm already on the lookout for Scar, and as for Cold, that information comes in handy, thank you very much.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_nazar_about_clear_sky_quest_second_talking_9">
		<text>I'll be waiting to hear.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pri_strelok_about_xlab_quest_talking_0">
		<text>Listen Shooter, do you know anything about X-labs?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_strelok_about_xlab_quest_talking_1">
		<text>Certainly I've had to visit most of them, are you interested in anything in particular?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_strelok_about_xlab_quest_talking_2">
		<text>Yes, do you have any papers or documents with you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pri_strelok_about_xlab_quest_talking_3">
		<text>All in all, there's something. About X-16 laboratory which is located on the Yantar. There's a machine there in the form of a giant brain that turns people into zombies. There's just one little problem. When I managed to get copies of the original documents on the lab here in Pripyat, I was tailed by a group of blues. It was in the Kindergarten area. I had to fight back and hide the documents just in case. Only now for the life of me do not remember where exactly I buried the stash - I then slightly concussed, good thing I survived. The blues were taking revenge on me for Wolfhound, the bastards. So now I don't need these documents. If you find them, take them. For them I will not ask anything.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pri_strelok_about_xlab_quest_talking_4">
		<text>Thank you, maybe I'll find something.</text>
    </string>		
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_begin_talking_0">
		<text>So, did you learn anything else interesting from the documents?</text>.
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_begin_talking_1">
		<text>In that documentation you brought, I found something interesting. It turns out that there is a prototype of the so-called "Product #58". It's a prototype gun whose action is based on electromagnetic bullet acceleration. Simply put, there is a prototype of a gauss gun. It's not quite working, of course. But if you want, I can fix it and modify it, as I have some experience with this class of weapon. Do you want to get such a weapon?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_begin_talking_2">
		<text>And you're still asking? What do I have to do?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_begin_talking_3">
		<text>First, bring me five units of the artifact Flash to create the power cells I need. I also need to find the prototype itself. According to the records, it should be in some lab called X-8. And I'll also need a schematic for building the shrunken electromagnetic coils. Most likely to be found at the Old BWC in Pripyat. A lot of technical documentation from various laboratories has been taken there. I'm only asking 10,000 rubles for the job itself. Well, will you take the job?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_begin_talking_4">
		<text>Agreed. I'll try to come back soon with a prototype, artefacts and schematic.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_begin_talking_5">
		<text>Okay, just come to me as soon as you find all three things at once, don't drag one at a time.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_begin_talking_6">
		<text>Excuse me while I have other things to do. Maybe I'll drop by later.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_begin_talking_7">
		<text>Well, suit yourself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_end_talking_0">
		<text>That's it, I've got the components you need. When can you get to work?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_end_talking_1">
		<text>Listen, I've been thinking, this is going to be harder than I thought at first.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_end_talking_2">
		<text>What's the problem?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_end_talking_3">
		<text>Mechanical defects in the prototype I can fix, no problem charging the batteries, but things are much worse with the coils. I haven't worked with such circuits much, and I don't have the radio elements either. So I contacted Nitrogen and he agreed to help me. So give me the prototype and the artefacts, and you take the coil schematics to Nitrogen. As soon as he makes them, I'll get on with the job.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_end_talking_4">
		<text>Okay, I'll be right there.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_kardan_quest_gauss_pistol_1_end_talking_5">

		<text>You see what the drunkard from Zaton is up to, he's making a gauss gun. The hell with it, he wants to do it, let him rip his anus, I may be able to make something like that soon. Give me the scheme of coils.</text>

		<text>The fuck knows. There's been a bit of a problem. The courier I sent to pick up the radio components hasn't been in touch for hours. And that's a problem. I can't do anything without the parts. So you'll have to find him.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_about_gauss_pistol_quest_2_first_talking_4">

	<string id="jup_gavaetc_about_gauss_pistol_quest_2_first_talking_1">
		<text>Yeah, there was an incident with him. Some guys from Svoboda got the drop on him. He sort of owed them something too, so they're keeping him in the East Tunnel now. Until he pays the debt, he'll get out of there.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_gavaetc_about_gauss_pistol_quest_2_first_talking_2">
		<text>Yeah, how in the world did he get so screwed up. So what do you think, should we go over there and sort it out?"</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_gavaetc_about_gauss_pistol_quest_2_first_talking_3">
		<text>And you don't know how to get screwed, Major? You go, maybe you'll get a deal, if it's important. If not, the freedom fighters can kill him - they won't get away with it.</text>

		<text>And here's the thing: Generally speaking, there is an illegal channel supplying high quality Afghan heroin in the Zone. And as you might have guessed, I control it.

		<text>So. I heard a rumor that some of the smugglers among the free stalkers hired by me - decided to lose part of the scheme to bypass me: well, the guys do not want to share, that's it. So we need to stop this outrage. In short, go to the agreed point, they will be waiting for you, you will introduce yourself that I'm here for the new shipment.They will have to send you the coordinates of the caches with the cargo.

    </string>
	<string id="zat_chapaev_quest_narko_kanal_begin_talking_10">

    </string>

		<text>So, a day ago my boys observed an entertaining scene. Two mercenaries, chasing one egg-headed scientist right down the road from that idiot Noah's barge.

		<text>And then what?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_chapaev_quest_narko_kan_end_talking_7">
		<text>My boys then sat near the gas station - from there the road is clearly visible - saw the blue-navigator right before the anomaly "Claw" caught up with, have time to discern that he was carrying some case, and then either ran out of ammo, or he went nuts, fuck. He went straight through the anomaly to the clefts. Well, the naims after him, then one on his feet and did not stand and went straight into the ramp, the second did not take a chance and rushed to the base. A scientist from the tunnels and never showed himself, probably died there. That's all I know.</text>

		<text>Fine, I knew I could count on you. Anyway, I decided to create a new exoskeleton, or rather a nano-exoskeleton using unique technology. I used to graduate in nanotechnology long time ago, before the zone, and now I think it's time to work on my specialty.</text>

	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_begin_talking_10">

	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_begin_talking_11">
		<text>You don't even have to bother with that one! OK, now let's get on with it. First I'd like to ask you to do the following - it's very important for me to know the opinion of other technicians who work in the Zone. Uncle Yar, Garin, and Kardan, so go tell them about my idea and ask what they think about it, and maybe they'll help me out with some advice. All the same, this is a serious matter, requires a more cardinal approach.</text>

	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_begin_talking_12">

		<text>Tell you, hmm, I think he'll do it himself - he's got the right hands and the highest degree of gold. So I think he just sent you here to show off. And if all the same he needs advice, I can tell him not to be bothered with Sevromotors - nanochevlar, which I think he is going to use is three times lighter than simple armored materials. That's why you should think of something special with the general hydraulics, to avoid using unnecessary force in vain. I think some material on hydraulics would be good for him to review.</text>

    </string>.
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_kardan_talking_2">
		<text>I'm here for a moment, for some advice for Nitrogen. He's decided to nano-technology on exoskeletons and he's interested in other mechanics' opinions.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_kardan_talking_3">
		<text>He's the one who decided to work off his jealousy, not the technology. Okay, if he cares about my opinion, listen: I understand that from scratch on the bolts he will not do exoskeleton based on what is available, will remove the old armor, and a few other things at the same time, and replace them with a new one made of nanomaterials, that is, electronics and other stuffing will hardly change. So, I advise him to choose a proper example of the original exoskeleton with good internal stuffing, from which to start dancing.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_kardan_talking_4">
		<text>Any particular option you can recommend?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_kardan_talking_5">
		<text>Yes, in principle, you can choose correctly. Look, an ordinary exoskeleton, which loners buy immediately falls out, because electronics there at three with a minus, it is clear that this is the very first generation, and still not even properly know how to make them, they just will be cheaper. The same way with the bandit's exoskeleton - virtually the same exoskeleton that the neutrals have, though they tweaked the electronics a little, but with hydraulics and other stuff they bumped it up a notch. Well, the Dolgov and Svoboda versions are unlikely to fit either. They have a lot of self-made stuff packed in them, and the filling is mediocre - in the Dolgov version there is more emphasis on the armour, in the Svoboda one - on weight reduction and use of lighter materials. So, nanoecksa originally material will be superlight, and will give better protection. It is worth taking a closer look at the variants of military and mercenary exoskeleton. In them all according to the highest grade made, current is not easy to get, and yet too complicated scheme they have compound parts, and electronics in the main Western goes - a lot of trouble to understand it properly will be. Well, monolithic - where will you get it, though it is also a variant. And a scientific exoskeleton is almost entirely based on nanotechnologies, there is no sense in taking it as the basis. The only remaining option is the "Dawn" or, even better, "Clear Skies" exoskeleton. They did a good job in their time. They had thought of everything, guys. And they used simple and reliable electric circuits, so there were no failures in their work. So you'd better take theirs, or if you want to be specific, the purebred, which Shusty sells. I've tried it once and I know, that everything is correct.</text>

	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_kardan_talking_6">
		<text>Well, thank you- I'll pass it on to Nitrogen.</text>

		<text>Good luck.</text>.
    </string>
	
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_novikov_talking_0">
		<text>Well Kulibin, there's a talk.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_novikov_talking_1">
		<text>Well, listen. What do you want?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_novikov_talking_2">
		<text>I'm on Azot's behalf. He has decided to create a nano-exoskeleton and decided to ask your advice on how best to do it.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_novikov_talking_3">
		<text>Oh, what a bug he is. He was jealous of Kardan's know-how in gauss technologies and decided to show off too. Well, well - flag in one place and drum to him, as they say.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_novikov_talking_4">
		<text>So should I just tell him that you're stupidly screwing him and that's all the advice?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_novikov_talking_5">
		<text>No, he always has time to go to three letters, in short, I wonder what will come of his idea, because before he was even steamed about where to get a stupid box with transistors and capacitors, and then I remember even a long search for some sophisticated tools for soldering grenades. And he will need a lot of things for nanoecks. So tell him to do it, but be very careful with this base material - I've heard, that scientists tried to bring here some consignment of kevlar, but their mercenaries had intercepted it before. I think it was somewhere near the Jupiter factory. But they did not manage to grab this material, all controllers were blocked, so where is it now - beats the shit out of me. And more in the near future deliveries of nanochevlar are not expected, so that he has more trouble on his head.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_novikov_talking_6">
		<text>Depressing though, but I guess we'll figure it out.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_novikov_talking_7">
		<text>And you're welcome, if I find out anything new, I'll let Azot know directly.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_0">
		<text>All, I polled the mechanics, I think the effect is there.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_1">
		<text>What did you find out?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_2">
		<text>So, it's in order - Jar thinks you'll have to do a lot of work with hydros, Kardan says a Clear Sky exoskeleton is best, and Garin warns that there may be a supply shortage of nanomaterials.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_3">
		<text>Damn, problems though, but let's approach things constructively. I've already done some sketches in the calculations, the tools are fine too, I just need to get all the consumables.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_4">
		<text>Okay, what exactly will you need?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_5">
		<text>I'll probably take the advice of the other techs, so you'll need to get two Clear Sky exoskeletons - I've heard they're very good indeed. Next, I need to figure out what to do with the nanokevlar, and finally need a new scheme for the hydraulic boosters and sevromechanisms.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_6">
		<text>Well, about the kevlar - Garin said that one batch was recently sown by scientists somewhere in the factory "Jupiter": like they were attacked by blues, but why would they with the material in the factory?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_7">
		<text>Yeah most likely the scientists wanted to shove it to the same mercenaries and more expensive, they just did not pay, they decided that so take it, except that heard there all the controllers covered. So when you go to the factory, be careful. I remember when we were going to the overpass, there was all sorts of paperwork and junk lying around. And then I found out about the overpass, that even laboratories might have been there some time ago, and a part of documentation might have got buried somewhere. Stalkers have bothered there only recently - probably not all have plundered yet - search there. It is possible that the information about the hydraulic boosters may not be directly connected with their use in the exoskeletons, but indirectly. There in the overpass of these amplifiers with the help of which the compartments were divided not one or two - I think you'll find what you need.</text>.
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_8">
		<text>And the exoskeletons, and why would you need two?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_9">
		<text>One for parts will go and the other will form the basis. I think just one exoskeleton you're better off in Shusty ordering, and about the second, recently Senka drunkenly blabbed that they say one of his friends had recently purchased just a "Clear Sky" exoskeleton, and left it in his stash. And this is his stash on "Jupiter"- just on your way will be, maybe, and you'll find it there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_10">
		<text>Good, then I'm off.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_1_end_talking_11">
		<text>Yeah, you'll come to me as soon as everything you need is available, well good luck.</text>
    </string>		
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_0">
		<text>Well, I've got everything you need. When can you get to work now?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_1">
		<text>Fine major. You've already done most of your work, but I don't think you can put an end to it just yet.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_2">
		<text>I don't get it, what else are you up to? Isn't all the stuff I brought along enough to make a nano-exoskeleton?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_3">
		<text>To create a simple nano-exoskeleton, yes, but I decided to go a little further and create a whole new groundbreaking class of armor.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_4">
		<text>What do you mean by new class?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_5">
		<text>A few hours ago Garin contacted me and told me some surprising things. He's learned that it is possible to use some technology to create nearly invisible objects.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_6">
		<text>Is that an invisible suit?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_7">
		<text>In principle, yes. A group of scientists have managed to develop technology that allows them to create, if not completely invisible objects, then, say, translucent ones that would be practically invisible from a distance of more than 50 meters. And that only if you know exactly where you want to look and what you want to see.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_8">
		<text>How's the miniculture of bloodsuckers?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_9">
		<text>Well almost, it's not the point. The main thing is that the professor, who was engaged in this development - Mironov seems to be his last name - is now in Pripyat. How he got there I don't know, information is very scarce. Exactly it is known that he is alive and is in a military base. There is information that his group was attacked by monoliths. So I think that you better go to Pripyat and meet with this professor.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_10">
		<text>Okay, but you still get to work, maybe your info is fake and there's no way to create invisible objects.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_azot_quest_nano_outfit_2_end_talking_11">

		<text>I didn't think the SBU would be intrigued by my work either. But believe me, I really can't help you anymore. If you're interested in my research into partial mimicry, it's irretrievably lost. Those barbarians stole everything as soon as we entered Pripyat.</text>

    </string>

		<text>Why are you in such an inopportune place, and even more so without proper military cover?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_azot_quest_nano_outfit_3_professor_first_talking_9">
		<text>In the Zone I work as a private citizen and unfortunately no longer cooperate with the official authorities. Therefore, the military only came to my rescue when it was already over. The military have no use for me, it is good that at least they did not consider me some sectarian and did not shoot him on the spot.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_azot_quest_nano_outfit_3_professor_first_talking_10">
		<text>It's clear, but at least where were you attacked?</text>.

		<text>This was not far from the Books shop. Major, I have no way of contacting my employers yet, so for now I'm stuck here indefinitely. As soon as my superiors manage to hire a mercenary unit, I'll leave town. It's a pity, but my labours will remain in the hands of the monoliths. Eh, if the military could afford to give me a squad of at least ten men, we could try to wrest them away from the sectarians.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_azot_quest_nano_outfit_3_professor_first_talking_12">

    </string>.
	<string id="pri_azot_quest_nano_outfit_3_professor_first_talking_13">
		<text>The case that holds all the papers is equipped with an electronic transmitter and is still active right now. Most likely, the monoliths attacked us purely by accident and have not yet realized what important documents have fallen into their hands.</text>.

		<text>Well, a hint as to who exactly might have been concluding?</text>.
    </string>

		<text>I'm listening carefully.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_11">
		<text>It's been suggested that a conspiracy against the syndicate has arisen, and perhaps not just against the syndicate. But I have no proof of that - only conclusions, which are worthless.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_13">
		<text>On your topic. There was a contract recently between the northeastern brigade and the libertarians, only it was very dubious. To be more exact, this contract was also offered to us, but we have a lot to do here, and it demanded almost all soldiers of the brigade. And the whole contract seemed so bogus.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_14">
		<text>And who was the mediator?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_15">
		<text>You're wondering that too, okay- a man came to the base, through my guide- so clean, I thought. Introduced himself as Varg, said, "It's a good deal, but it needs a lot of payback. I offered him a good price, but I still refused, and I already told you that I was not up to it yet. But if he'd needed only ten men, he'd have agreed, but he needed at least thirty. And this Varg himself... ...he looked so familiar.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_16">
		<text>What about the northeast brigade?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_17">
		<text>And they were broke then - they were offered one-time contracts for two or three people. And here it was for the whole brigade at once. So Jason signed for himself and his Argonauts. Although, too, doubts ripened in him.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_18">
		<text>Yes, which ones?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_19">
		<text>Well, at first they were fine: sort of secure the caravan, control the supply of weapons so no soul would go anywhere near them. And then the freedman Varg says, they will have to deal with a couple of Drogov. Well, Jason was writing to me afterwards - we are screwed, we signed up for provocation. I said to him: maybe it would be better to leave - you will stand between two fires: "Freedom" and "Duty". They will eat you with the shit of a pseudo-giant. You know, Jason, like, we're the best. Anyway, they were all fucked up. And for that I have got - Debtors of Jason with brigade, together with the freedom fighters, whom Varg has sent to help to protect weapons - in two accounts. It turned out that the contract was a real fake - all were killed.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_20">
		<text>That's a sad thing to say, but I just want to tell you one thing. The Warg you mentioned was not for Freedom, but for the "Duty" - their infiltrator.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_21">
		<text>Is that even how it comes out - so "The Debt" benefited from this whole mess?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_22">
		<text>I don't know. Varg is officially a Dolg man, except he wasn't acting on their orders at the time. There's a little man called Anubis, he's a libertarian, he was in control of the whole thing. And after eliminated Warg and the Dowgov, who took part in the massacre of the mercenaries and the "freedom.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_23">
		<text>How the fuck does it work-it looks like Freedom set this whole thing up and covered its tracks themselves.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_24">
		<text>Not really. Anubis probably isn't exactly a pure libertarian either, seems to be just a cover. I do not know who he may be, but he plays big. Struggles clans on the plain - but why?</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_begin_talking_25">
		<text>I want to figure it out too. When Hog gets back from under Limansk, I'll have him digging under that Anubis of yours -- he's probably an agent too, but not a Freeman or military one, that's for sure. Whose is it? That's the question. Well, let's leave it at that- I've got an idea, and you're going to help me.</text>

		<text>It wasn't that long ago that Ridge's squad was wiped out on Zaton. He had some very valuable data stored in his laptop. Who took it I do not know - people say some pro goblins. But that laptop went to the side - someone on "Skadovsk. So, go to Zaton and try to find this information - I do not think that this information was sold on.</text>.

		<text>Tell me, Beard, what do you know about Raccoon?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_boroda_talking_1">
		<text>Yeah, what can I say about him - a cheap condom, that's what he is, a cheapskate and a rare scum, but his product is consistently good - so he hangs on, although the prices overdo it.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_boroda_talking_2">
		<text>And what do you know about his roof?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_boroda_talking_3">
		<text>The roof is a local gang - not the Sultans, that's for sure. But the guys are serious too - not losers with rifles. Rich supplies them with good gear - that's a fact. Except these guys are a real pain in the ass for ordinary stalkers. Hunting only those who come back from raids and loaded. They're probably tipped off by Sych himself, though that's not for sure. In a word, they're reckless. It's high time to kill them, but no one gets around to it.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_boroda_talking_4">
		<text>I can take care of that, because Sych is really starting to get a little bit cocky - not good for him.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_boroda_talking_5">
		<text>That's good. So, this gang is unlikely to appear here this afternoon, and tomorrow I gather they're planning a raid. That's when you'll get them. I'll send you a message.</text>
    </string>	
	
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_2_talking_0">
		<text>Well, Cheechara, there goes your gang. Come on, give me the laptop and we'll go our separate ways.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_2_talking_1">
		<text>Fuck the roof, the other one will be better than the old one, but I should thank you for fixing it, it was useless anyway. As for the mercenary's laptop, I sold it. Courier left about an hour ago. But the coordinates of his PDA I'll let you know in time to intercept it do what you want, but do not kill - there is a serious customer.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_2_talking_2">
		<text>You're a bitch, Raccoon. Alright, I'll catch up with the courier, and I'll talk to you later...</text>

    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_2">
		<text>Witness, and it wouldn't have done any good anyway - he managed to get the laptop to the customer. My men were watching him. And then you showed up and spooked the bird.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_3">
		<text>Couldn't you interrogate him, then sew him up?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_4">
		<text>Mayor, don't get cocky - don't you think it's not in your position to be pushing rights right now? Just because Molfar's men didn't shoot you doesn't mean you're clean and can do business with us on an equal footing.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_5">
		<text>what do you mean?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_6">
		<text>About what? Need I remind you how the laptop got to Raccoon? I'll take that as a verbal warning, one more stunt like that's gonna cost you. But as long as you live, it's to our advantage that you're in this mess now too. And about that courier... We caught him giving the laptop to a Libertarian - can't you guess who?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_7">
		<text>Anubis, the creature...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_8">
		<text>He is the one. He's the reason I'm here. He owes us too much.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_9">
		<text>What do you know about him?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_10">
		<text>Anubis is one of the most professional saboteurs working in the Zone. Who his masters are is unknown to me, but that he is a special agent is beyond doubt. He's been on our radar for a long time. He was involved in the death of one of the southwestern brigades two years ago in the Dark Valley. Then he managed to pit us against the freedom fighters, and he's sentenced to death in absentia. That alone will not solve the whole problem.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_11">
		<text>The fact that Anubis is not a libertarian I realized long ago, I know he has wide connections as in "The Debt", possibly among the freemen as well. Then why did Molfar pretend he didn't know anything?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_12">
		<text>You better not go to him yet, or he'll shoot the hell out of you for Hook, Backbone and the rest. I could barely get him not to kill you. Molfar found out the other day, and he didn't believe me. I helped him to sort it all out.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_13">
		<text>What are you going to do?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_14">
		<text>The people behind Anubis have most likely commissioned him to carry out a large-scale sabotage of the Zone, targeting the major groups-Dolga, Liberty, and us. The aim is most likely to be our general weakening against the others.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_15">
		<text>Are you counting the Monolith as others?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_16">
		<text>Not only. Other sectarians from the south of the Zone have recently become active.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_17">
		<text>"Sin"?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_18">
		<text>Themselves. So far they're not really hustling here, but it's only a matter of time. The most plausible version is that Anubis is a sinner. That alone explains what he's doing.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_19">
		<text>Then why didn't you kill him now that he was in your people's sight?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_20">
		<text>For me personally, he's already worked out - I'll kill him when I see fit. The main thing now is that he will lead me to those who are behind him.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_molfar_quest_killer_notebook_sich_hog_talking_21">
		<text>You let me know then, I need to ask them some questions too.</text>

		<text>Our brothers were recently attacked, killing everyone who was there. It happened not far from here, near the Gastronome building.

Soon they were attacking several of our artifact hunters, but you already know that.

		<text>How's it going?</text>
	</string>
    <string id="jup_dolg_leader_secret_agent_dialog_quest_end_0">
		<text>Mercenary patrols destroyed. True, it was a bit of a struggle.</text>
	</string>
    <string id="jup_dolg_leader_secret_agent_dialog_quest_end_1">
		<text>Fine. Now listen carefully. The mercenaries don't always come to the tunnel, there are often freedom fighters with them. There are about fifteen or twenty men in all. Snipers - from above on the platform and in the windows. One group is always downstairs and the rest are always inside the compound. They also bring in new merchandise from time to time. The main customers should be here any day now. That's why you need to talk to Shulga right away. I think he'll coordinate with Varg, and then we can go up against Freedom and blow the place clean. That's all the intel we could dig up. That's it, we need to move to the assembly point.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_1">
		<text>No mate, now you have a case and I have to prepare you for it and give you a quick briefing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_2">

	</string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_3">
		<text>Now you'll understand, pick up the regular uniforms, equipment and weapons of the rank-and-file fighter of our faction here. I've given you twice as much ammunition as I should have, but you've got a bigger task ahead of you. Introduction: we need to move to a specified point, to clear the area of mutants and find a missing man in the area. Is the task clear?</text>
	</string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_4">
		<text>No friend, hooey. That's not the way things are done. Without my consent, moreover, I'm not a member of your faction...</text>.

	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_5">
		<text>Consider yourself temporarily seconded by your commanders to us sympathisers. And here's getting your secondment, I think they'll suit you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_6">
		<text>Fair enough, but still, what's the point of this circus. What, Shulga couldn't say directly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_7">
		<text>So he couldn't. There is an opinion that there is a mole on Janov, and a serious one, it is not clear who he works for, but the information is leaking is a fact, so the instruction you received from me. Our counter-intelligence, with Varg at the helm, is just a handshake. And svobodivtsy are trying to fend them off, as if they are not involved.</text>
	</string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_8">
		<text>Is this all to do with what happened to your artifact collectors?</text>.
	</string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_9">
		<text>Possible. The blues aren't just going to attack anybody, and it's not artifacts they're after - only bandits can do that. On show provocation smells like that. But who hired the blues?</text>
	</string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_10">
		<text>Any thoughts?</text>.
	</string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_11">
		<text>Freemen fear and swear they're not involved, stoners don't do business with blues. They'll attack whoever they want, there's no reason for them to give money to the side. Sinners - they even more fucked up than the stone-dwellers, but why the fuck should they do that?</text>

		<text>not much...</text>.
	</string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_stalker_trader_quest_mutants_talking_15">
		<text>Warg will tell you the rest later, but in the meantime, deal with the mutants - we think that too, they have appeared at the cement, and I think we saw poltergeists and zombies. They've never been here before and not in such numbers. It looks like a wave from Pripyat. Besides, our man who went missing there was working with Varg. And it's very important that you find him. The scout himself is on another mission, so take the initiative in your hands and do not linger there.</text>

	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_1">
		<text>Yeah slowly, we're not complaining, but we've got a bit of a hassle here. You how - moonlighting do not mind, and now I have all the quads on the job, no one free.</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_2">
		<text>I can basically help, what do I need to do?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_3">
		<text>We need to follow the PDA signal of several of our fighters who are not in contact, and find out if they are alive or not.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_4">
		<text>When was the last time they made contact?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_5">
		<text>Two hours ago are both of our artifact collectors assigned to the scientists. And Herman, by the way, is also worried - because they were supposed to deliver another shipment to them on time, they haven't been in contact with him either. The PDA signals are almost static, but they don't seem to be dead, so we have to check.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_6">
		<text>Okay, what about the supply of artifacts, since the scientists don't care who brings them in as I assume?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_7">
		<text>If the urge is there, take it to the scientists, again if you discover it. But I have a hunch that it's just a load of artefacts that's the problem. Probably, the bandits have prykarili, but still, you figure it out yourself.</text>
    </string>

	<string id="jup_dolg_1_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_2">
		<text>Don't be angry, it's from Shulga - you can tell him it's fine. It's just that the anomalous field is rabid here. All frequencies are jammed.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_1_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_3">
		<text>Okay, but I was told by the lieutenant colonel to pick up the cargo and carry it to the scientists, and also to check on your partner.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_1_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_begin_talking_4">
		<text>He went to the Floats, and there the connection is always fine; maybe something could have happened to him. As for the artifacts - if the lieutenant colonel ordered it, then take them, but do not try to hide with them.</text>

    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_end_talking_2">
		<text>No, I delivered as expected, Herman was satisfied. But one of your pickers is dead, he was put down by the mercenaries and yet didn't take the valuable loot. I was only a minute late - the guy didn't stand a chancASXe.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_end_talking_3">
		<text>Fucking hell, this is too unpleasant a twist. But why would the blues want to kill ours, like we have peace with them? Moreover, killed on purpose as I understand it, but did not rob it - doubly strange.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_end_talking_4">

	<string id="jup_dolg_sulga_quest_sborshiki_artefactov_end_talking_5">
		<text>Will solve the problem, and with your help, by the way here's for your efforts, and also - look at the captain Zvyagintsev - our procurer. He had business with you.</text>
    </string>

		<text>Good job Major, without your help could not do, all the clans are very grateful to you, both financial and human.</text>
    </string> 
	<string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_2">
		<text>Why was there no help for so long, almost everyone died holding there. Where were your lauded mutant fighter quads?"</text>.
    </string>. 
	<string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_3">
		<text>Calm down, I understand you can't come to your senses yet, but the death of the others isn't your fault-it's the Zone and they knew it would probably be. And about the reinforcements... they came as soon as they could.</text>
    </string>. 
	<string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_4">
		<text>Okay, my gear and weapons are pretty much worn out and I'm running out of ammo. Can you help me solve this problem?</text>
    </string> 
	<string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_5">
		<text>Yeah, sure- here's a full set of first-class gear and more cash on top. But that's not all.</text>
    </string> 
	<string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_6">
		<text>What's the matter, another problem?</text>
    </string> 
	<string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_7">
		<text>In general yes. Remember you reported to Shulga about the mercenaries who attacked our collector?</text>.
    </string> 
	<string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_8">
		<text>Yeah, that's how it all started - thanks, it's called a favour to the Lieutenant Colonel.</text>
    </string> 
	<string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_9">
		<text>Now you can report to him personally. The situation seems to have cleared up a bit - our scout Varg has managed to find out a few things. But one thing at a time, anyway stop by Shulga - he wants to have a word with you.</text>
    </string> 
    <string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_10">
		<text>good.</text>.
    </string>
    <string id="jup_dolg_trader_quest_gon_end_talking_11">
		<text>Well, that's great, if anything, check it out.</text>
    </string>	
    <string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_0">
		<text>I was informed that you wanted to have a word with me, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_1">
		<text>Yes, Major. Heard how you held off the mutants at the warehouse - I'm impressed. Not a lot of people can show that kind of cool when they see a bunch of monsters rushing in. We could use such fighters in the grouping.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_2">
		<text>I don't think you summoned me to describe my combat credentials, and certainly not to recruit me to the "Duty" - that's for sure. So what about the mercenaries, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_3">
		<text>Okay, you want to get right to the point, be my guest. So Vargu- this is our counter-intelligence, managed to gather some information about this attack.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_4">
		<text>I'm listening.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_5">
		<text>As we suspected, the mercenaries didn't set up the ambush by accident-they were hired to do it. And it seems the employer was a stalker "Liberty".</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_6">
		<text>I wonder why they didn't attack themselves then - after all they could have done just as well. Why sign someone on the side. Are they afraid of something?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_7">
		<text>No, the freedom fighters are afraid of almost no one - it appears that they do not want to go into direct conflict with us yet and avoid open confrontation. That is why mercenaries arranged this provocation.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_8">
		<text>Well, killing one artifact collector isn't that much of a provocation yet.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_9">
		<text>What did you want them to do, cut out a couple of quads at once- they won't wait.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_10">
		<text>At least it becomes clear why the freedom fighters didn't participate in defending the warehouse from mutants.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_11">
		<text>Yeah, you got that right. Although they could have helped, like Dawn or the Free. But the most baffling thing is that it seems that this wasn't their only contract with the mercenaries. And their task is not only to pit us against each other, but something else.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_12">
		<text>What exactly?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_13">
		<text>I don't know exactly. You'd better talk to Varg about it in more detail - he's more in control of the situation now than anyone else. I think he will share his knowledge with you.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_14">
		<text>And where do I look for Varg?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_shulga_talking_15">
		<text>Why look for him - he's not far from Janov.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_0">
		<text>So you're Diagtyarev?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_1">
		<text>He's the one, so you're a Warg?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_2">
		<text>He's the one. Alright, let's leave all this politeness to the meeting - get to the point. Did Shulga have time to tell you everything?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_3">
		<text>Well, in general terms, yes.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_4">
		<text>I see, so it's not all. The situation is now shaping up in the lousiest way possible. It looks like someone is benefiting from intentionally pitting the Dol against Freedom, and in such a way that we are to blame for the carnage's unraveling. However, as I have learned, this may not be the sole purpose of the clients.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_5">
		<text>Explain.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_6">
		<text>One of my bluesmen recently reported that someone has hired a whole brigade of fighters from the syndicate-not entirely clear why, but it's probably not just a one-time contract.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_7">
		<text>Funny, usually mercenaries are only offered a one-off.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_8">
		<text>How would you know? That you yourself worked for the blues before the official authorities?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_9">
		<text>How do you know that - maybe you're a mercenary yourself, but in the "duty" so "stupid number"?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_10">
		<text>Oh, I don't think we're gonna work out, Major.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_11">
		<text>And don't, you tell me what you know and then Shulga and I will decide what to do. After all, he's the one who asked me to help, not you.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_12">
		<text>You were asked by the "Duty", not the lieutenant colonel - don't forget!</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_13">
		<text>You're going to tell me more about your ideas, where were you while we were holding mutants back, you could have helped?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_14">
		<text>I did something that probably won't cause more breakthroughs like this. So enough bullshit, chief - listen as you used to, if you don't want to have a nice conversation: it is known that a group of mercenaries may have been hired to cover and protect a major new arms supply channel. The alleged employer is Freedom, but I'm not sure - the weapons are obviously not meant for them: they're probably middlemen too. Sabotage against us was planned by freedom fighters, but clearly under someone's orders - that's what we have to find out.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_first_talking_15">

		<text>He promised to get in touch tonight, he'll tell you the place. And about his skin, so you know yourself - snitches do not live long in the Zone, but I do not want to moron, as long as he's profitable to me.

		<text>Okay. The contract was made a week ago - one of the local merchants has established a new particularly large channel of supply of artifacts from the Zone and equipment from the Big Land. With goblins he's all set there, they've secured passage through Kordon. And here in the Zone - we'll have to strain ourselves to deliver the cargo safely in both directions. But it is not the main thing - illegal deliveries were, are and will be, there is nothing that can be changed. The point is that the weapons and equipment should not go to us or to the blues, but somewhere on the side.</text>

	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_gusak_talking_10">
		<text>That's the problem - there's an idea that Loki doesn't even know what's going on, or if he does, not all of it</text>.

		<text>Such a theme, in short, about the control of supply he gave our guys orders - I heard myself, but the attack on the Drogovtsy was out of the question - we're kind of like a peace agreement with you here unspoken, but there's a - you know.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_gusak_talking_13">
		<text>And who controls the delivery from your side, if not Loki personally?</text>.

	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_gusak_talking_14">
		<text>This one, friend, I don't know. But also not the last person - he definitely did not appear on Janov - probably from our main base on the Militar.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_gusak_talking_15">
		<text>All right, well, who do you think might be the customer of the cargo if not your clan?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_gusak_talking_16">
		<text>I don't know, just a personal guess-perhaps someone who is a fanatic. But it's only a guess.</text>

	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_gusak_talking_17">

    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_4">
		<text>This is unlikely. The stonemasons (Monolith) have their own supply channels, while the other lame-o's don't have that financial capability.</text>

		<text>And "Sin"?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_6">
		<text>What's Sin? These penitents rarely stick their noses further than the Redwoods. They don't used to go near Dark Vale, not much better than bandits or Renegades and Blackslugs. Same thing. This is only later they were so brainwashed, that even more fanatical monoliths have.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_7">
		<text>Stange, I heard that a lot of sinners among the "Free Stalkers"-like your snitchy Gusak-anywhere sniffing. And they can not be called bandits.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_8">
		<text>Hey, spetsura, how long have you been in the Zone? Trust my experience - "Sin" is hardly capable of such a thing. Stone crushers would have been fine, but then again, they wouldn't have needed it for fuck's sake. They would have stupidly made a raid from Pripyat, and would have put half of the local tramps without any of the arcane intricacies. Something else is different here.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_9">
		<text>What do you think?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_10">
		<text>We'll find out soon enough. In short, Shulga has given the go-ahead for the operation. After all, the fact remains that the Mercenaries and Svoboda have been spotted. This is already enough to untie the "duty"'s hands. It doesn't matter if they started it themselves or if someone put them up to it. In general, they need to conduct reconnaissance, specifically to cut off the supply line.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_11">
		<text>How do you have something specific in mind?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_12">
		<text>Yes, a quad of our agents disguised as free-riders have scoured almost all around, trying to figure out where the mercenaries with the libertarians have a staging area. They almost succeeded - most likely the Eastern tunnels near "Jupiter". They'd been seeing a lot of activity in the tunnels, both Freemen and Blues. And yesterday - Marmedon - the commander of the scouts reported that they seem to have started to bring weapons and equipment there.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_13">
		<text>Then they should all get their asses kicked there.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_14">
		<text>You'll get there, Major. Now meet up with those agents and check out what's going on around that place-get more intel and be careful not to spook the bigger bird. Although not the fact that it will arrive.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_15">
		<text>I get it, I perform.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_diversant_varg_second_talking_16">
		<text>I'll report to my commander in the meantime to start working out an assault plan. And with Shulga there is something to coordinate.</text>.

	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_tonnel_batle_shulga_first_talking_7">
		<text>Okay, go for it. At least we'll nail the freedom fighters and mercenaries, and we can deal with the customer later. I'm assigning two quads to the operation. One of the battle commanders, Shaitan, will lead it. Charon with additional forces will appear earlier.</text>

    </string>.
	<string id="jup_dolg_quest_tonnel_batle_shulga_second_talking_5">
		<text>Okay, I guess Varg will have something to do now. Let him start digging for sinners. It's not enough we have monoliths, we have fanatics here all of a sudden.</text>

		<text>Really? That he doesn't know, I don't believe it. Remember, Varg knows practically everything about inter-clan fighting. That's why we manage to survive in them. And Liberty and the Mercenaries, as I understand it, have become mere expendables. It's a shame, but I think a major conflict can be avoided. I've already spoken to Loki.</text>.

		<text>Why don't I know? I know! After you left here, the Avenger almost followed you.

Where exactly he went - I can't say, he didn't say. Wait, wait!

		<text>Nothing, you say? Well, let's see... Not as bad as it looks... I've got some software that's great for this kind of thing. Plug it in... Wow! That's some protection, huh? You know, you take your PDA and go to Nitrous. You can show it to Kardan while you're at it. A PDA like that belonged to a Debtor, not an ordinary one, and it's too expensive to hack. They will immediately broadcast that the hacked PDA one of the commander, then we have a problem with the Dolgovtsy.</text>

		<text>You know how many loners like this I see every day? But wait... Recently, you say? There was a stalker here exactly three hours ago. Right, I remember, and he was wearing a leather jacket and carrying a Bison. Must have come from Zaton, or I would have known him by now. He introduced himself as Zeleny, bought a bottle of vodka and sat in the corner. Then a longshoreman joined him and they talked about something for forty minutes.

    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_ava_first_talking_1">
		<text>Yes, passed it on. Kanevsky's PDA miraculously survived the explosion, but I could not use it - there is some incredible protection, I had to give Azot. You know, you should have at least warned me what was really in those "fireworks". I almost got blown up in there, too. Of course I suspected something, the parcel looked too much like a well-packaged C-4, but I didn't even think about this turn of events. Why were you even putting on a show like that in the first place? Why did you kill that Debtor, and in such an... unusual way? An old score?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_ava_first_talking_2">
		<text>Well, thank you! You've earned your reward! Now to answer your questions. No, I did not have any "old scores" against Kanevsky. The point is completely different. The death of Kanevsky played a crucial role - the fate of Zaton and everyone else who trades there in the search for artifacts largely depended on this man. Kanevsky kept electronic copies of some documents, and I have the originals, so the loss of his PDA is nothing. Here are the coordinates of my cache, in addition to the documents there you will take everything else as payment for the work.</text>
    </string>.

	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_ava_first_talking_4">
		<text>I think "The Debt" is hardly involved here, and acted on his own accord, but with someone else's tip-off. It all looks like a planned sabotage, but who was planning it? Anyway, you'll read the documents and then decide what to do. Okay, goodbye, I have to go.</text>

		<text>Greetings, Warden. I happen to be in possession of a DA of one of your men.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_1">
		<text>What?! Kanevsky is dead?!</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_2">
		<text>Well... yes. I found his corpse on Zaton, and picked up the PDA from him. I've already given it to Azoth, and I brought you some documents in the original so to speak, after all, "The Duty" needs to find out what happened to his man. And get to the bottom of it.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_3">
		<text>Good job, Major. I appreciate such people and will not leave you without reward. And as for Kanevsky, I think there was no need to drag him into this story, I think Varg himself would have coped, but as it happened - may his eternal memory.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_4">
		<text>And why would Varga do all this?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_5">
		<text>Listen, don't ask too many questions - Varg is our best intelligence agent and he doesn't answer to me, but to Voronin or his deputies directly. So take what you can, "Duty" will not forget, and if I find out anything out about what I think is a fake alliance with bandits, I'll let you know.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_6">
		<text>Don't you think it's odd, even for a Dolgian scout, to collude with bandits, and for such a dubious purpose?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_7">
		<text>Why is it dubious, surely Varg would just sniff out all the local gangs and then we'd hit them with a single blow. Don't you believe it?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_8">
		<text>No. There was one stalker - The Avenger - he managed to find out a lot about this mess with the bandits and I think it's not what you think.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_9">
		<text>Where is this Avenger of yours?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_10">
		<text>dead, killed by bandits.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_11">
		<text>Yes, then I'll follow Varg's next steps, but so far his actions have never come under suspicion. And you in turn go to Zaton and warn the inhabitants of Skadovsk of a possible attack from the bandits.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_12">
		<text>OK, I'm on my way.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_shulga_first_talking_13">
		<text>Good luck.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_0">
		<text>Hi!</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_1">
		<text>Oh, man! Good to see you! What you came for!</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_2">
		<text>I thought I'd warn you and your rastamans. If you don't do something about it soon, "The Debt" will take control of Zaton and then knock you out. And he wants to do it in a very cunning way, not getting dirty himself, but using the local gangs.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_3">
		<text>Fucking hell! That's some info, man! How do you prove it?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_4">
		<text>And with what. Here's the paperwork. This belonged to Kanevsky, you probably know him, Shulga's man. Don't make such round eyes, and read, read to the end, there are many more interesting things there.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_5">
		<text>It seems true, I could not even think that the "Duty" is planning such a ... Well, let's go, let's help Zaton, gather all forces and steel fist, so to speak, cover all bandits and Dungov, so they for the lack of forces, not only for Jupiter, but for "Janov" could not stick their noses out. And keep the new gear - we can not leave such information without reward.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_6">
		<text>And what exactly are you going to do?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_7">
		<text>I think my trusted person will handle this - he's a master of his craft and will be able to find the right solution. And to be honest I'm confused that The Debt was able to stoop to an alliance with the Bandits, it's probably not that simple after all. That's why there's no way around it without Anubis.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_8">
		<text>You'd better plug it in. And tell him that one stalker, who managed to steal the documents from the dolgovtsy already killed by bandits and there is no way to delay.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_9">
		<text>Okay, then if this isn't a setup after all and the bandits are really getting ready to attack Skadovsk, you'd better warn the locals about the threat.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_10">
		<text>Okay, I'll do it.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_quest_story_of_avenger_loki_first_talking_11">
		<text>Good luck.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_first_talking_0">
		<text>I have extremely important information</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_first_talking_1">
		<text>Bah! What people on our ship! Well, did you find your Avenger?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_first_talking_2">
		<text>Yeah, found it... Anyway, I'll get straight to the point: thanks to the Avenger, we managed to uncover the Dolg's plans for Skadovsk. The Avenger would have told you a lot more about it, but unfortunately he's dead.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_first_talking_3">
		<text>See how. What's the information?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_first_talking_4">
		<text>Listen and remember: the Dolg saboteurs, namely Varg hired the bandits, are due to attack Skadovsk any day now. And it will be not some rabble with "Makarovs" and "rip-offs", but well equipped and organized forces - dolgovtsy organized their arms supply, it seems some Morgan was engaged in it. In short, we need to urgently gather all combat-ready loners to defend the ship.</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_first_talking_5">
		<text>Wow, wow... When I refused to set up the Dolga base here, I had no idea it would turn out like this... That's a load of crap! Yes, our affairs are bad... And now the stalkers who are more experienced are reaching for Jupiter, there's nothing for them here any more - boredom is deadly, there are almost no artifacts. So it turns out that the only stalkers we have left for defence are very green ones, they're just kids, and some of them don't even know how to shoot good enough... But wait a minute... Exactly! There are three rather large and well-armed groups of experienced stalkers camping nearby. I've done them a favour recently, so it's about time they worked it off. So: find the leaders of these groups - Maple, Falcon and Granite, they usually try to walk alone so as not to attract attention - tell the situation and order them to come to "Skadovsk" at night, I think these things just then in the attack will fly. The coordinates of these stalkers I sent you on the DA.</text>.
    </string>.	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader1_first_talking_0">
		<text>Hello. Is there a case?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader1_first_talking_1">
		<text>Yes, exactly. There's no time to explain everything in detail, so get the gist: Beard said that as payment for that service, you should do the following. Skadovsk will be attacked by bandits, and if you help us fight back, you'll get what you owe. So gather your people and you will be at "Skadovsk" by nightfall, if anything is unclear, Beard will explain everything on the spot.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader1_first_talking_2">
		<text>Lady, I've got three more with me - everyone will be on time.</text>

		<text>Goodbye.</text>
    </string>.	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader2_first_talking_0">
		<text>Oh, a stalker on the horizon! Why come?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader2_first_talking_1">
		<text>I'm from Beard. He asks to be at Skadovsk by nightfall, it's very important.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader2_first_talking_2">
		<text>Hmmm... What's that for?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader2_first_talking_3">
		<text>The Skadovsk will tell you everything. In general terms: the ship is to be attacked by bandits, and if you help in the defense - you will do Beard a favor for a favor.</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader2_first_talking_4">
		<text>You should have said so right away. Just take into account that most of our guys raided Jupiter, so there will only be three of us</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader2_first_talking_5">
		<text>Also good.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader2_first_talking_6">
		<text>Good luck.</text>.
    </string>.	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader3_first_talking_0">
		<text>And hello to you too</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader3_first_talking_1">
		<text>My regards to you too. I have an important matter to you. Skadovsk is to be attacked by bandits, as a repayment of your debt Beard offers to help repel their attack. How do you agree?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader3_first_talking_2">
		<text>Yes, only there's a problem. As of late I am no longer the group leader and unfortunately no one but me will come to the rescue. But I will try to be there before anyone else and delay the bandits on the way.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader3_first_talking_3">
		<text>But don't stay on your point too long-we don't want dead heroes</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_leader3_first_talking_4">
		<text>And I'm not going to die.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_second_talking_0">
		<text>I have spoken to the stalker commanders.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_second_talking_1">
		<text>So what? Will they arrive by the deadline?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_second_talking_2">
		<text>Yes, but there will only be eight.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_second_talking_3">
		<text>Eight!? Fuck, then we're all going to get chopped up.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_second_talking_4">
		<text>They will not. The main thing is to distribute people properly on positions and plenty of ammunition, then we will beat them off for sure.</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_second_talking_5">
		<text>Yeah, by the way, about the ammo, Klen sent a message - he says they're low on ammo: two rounds per brother. We can't hold out with that kind of ammo. Where am I gonna get ammo? I'm a bartender! Why don't you go to Rye?</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_first_talking_0">
		<text>Come on, friend, shovel your supplies.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_first_talking_1">
		<text>I don't fucking get it. What do you want, goblin?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_first_talking_2">
		<text>Knowledgeable people told me that you can get ammo from you. Skadovsk is to be attacked by bandits, and the defenders have a horn per brother. Would you mind sharing a box? Remember, the fate of the ship depends on it, don't be stingy.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_first_talking_3">
		<text>Maybe the fate of the ship depends, but not mine - I'll get along with anyone. Share, of course, I can, but I'm afraid that I will not have much of myself after that. All right, I'll give it to you, but I want you to do some work for me. Anyway, listen, there's been a gang of thugs around here lately. Bitchy bitches like you. Okay, there's not a lot of scumbags in the Zone, but here's the thing: they tracked down the routes my shuttles take, and they're going after them. I'm already in the 4th day of sitting on the old stockpile, not one has not yet reached me with the goods. If you kill these thugs, it's all right, the box of ammo is yours. Now I'll send you their approximate coordinates - and go hero.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_first_talking_4">
		<text>OK, I will. Otherwise, this gang will still show up at night - it makes sense to bring them down before.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_first_talking_5">
		<text>That's a good point you made. All the guys around went crazy - they are preparing for an attack, and they did not have a chance to live like that.</text>
    </string>.	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_second_talking_0">
		<text>All right, I've killed those thieves</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_second_talking_1">
		<text>Somebody's Rambo... All right, relax, you helped my business, well done. Now for the reward. Like I told you, I'm sitting on old supplies, I don't have enough ammo for a box. In short, look: I used the PDA of one of the recently killed leaders of the bandits to get information about the approximate location of the cache, where they hid the stolen goods. There should be enough ammo there to arm a small army. So if you find the cache, it'll be yours. Just keep in mind, there are only approximate coordinates near Emerald. Well, good luck to you.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_second_talking_2">
		<text>Fuck! It's never like that with you.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_sich_second_talking_3">
		<text>And the fucking business. Get the fuck out of here...</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_third_talking_0">
		<text>I think there's plenty of ammo here.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_third_talking_1">
		<text>Good, that's what we've been missing the most, but there will be another errand. I've been rummaging around in my stash and found a few sets of C-4 explosives. I've had them since I was a stalker. So I consulted with Granit - he said that it would do us good to mine the approaches to "Skadovsk" to make it easier to defend. He advised me to disguise mines as ordinary stalker backpacks. A few newcomers had already hidden them in the most important routes to Skadovsk. All that's left is to plant the explosives. Will you do it?</text>
    </string>.	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_third_talking_2">
		<text>Yes, of course. It won't be superfluous, only who will undermine them afterwards?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_third_talking_3">
		<text>Don't worry about that. Granit has decided to personally lead the defence and he'll make sure the mines go off when they're needed - at the most opportune moment.</text>
    </string>.	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_fouth_talking_0">
		<text>All, I've mined all approaches to the ship.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_fouth_talking_1">
		<text>Well done! Now everything is done to repel the bandits.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_fouth_talking_2">
		<text>When do you think they'll get in?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_quest_defence_of_skladovsk_boroda_fouth_talking_3">
		<text>We'll wait for their attack. While you were gone, our guys caught one of their scouts, and before they shot him, he said that they will attack at night, at 3 o'clock, or even earlier, then come to me - I need to tell you something.</text>
    </string>.
	
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_0">
		<text>Comrade Colonel, no new information from headquarters?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_1">
		<text>Why hasn't it come in? There is information, Major. There is another opportunity to understand what is really going on here and how to resolve the situation.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_2">
		<text>I am listening to you carefully, Comrade Colonel.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_3">
		<text>So, Major. The current situation does not satisfy the command. It believes that such high Sin group activity could not have arisen out of nothing. At the headquarters there is a clear link between the recent events, and we will have to determine the cause, the root cause of the problem.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_4">
		<text>Do you think this is solely about a sectarian group?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_5">
		<text>No, they're just another performer. However, I can't get the gist of one report from our agent, that perhaps the sinners were acting in concert with the monoliths. This information is still unverified, but it's not up to that now either. Command believes that the time is not right to seriously deal with the problem of sinners - there are more important issues, and the resolution of this problem can be directly linked to the activities of the clan "Sin".</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_6">
		<text>What exactly is the case? And why do you think sectarians are involved in all the recent events?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_7">
		<text>I didn't say so. No one is entirely sure of that. Maybe they are not. But in general I will tell you the essence of the problem first, and then we will draw conclusions. Because I see you do not quite understand what we're talking about.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_8">
		<text>good.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_9">
		<text>It goes like this: we received a tip from one of our own among the traders, saying that long ago in the Zone, even before the disaster may have been working on the creation of biological weapons. Information is unfortunately too little. The agent was unable to find out the name of the project, nor where it took place. There is only scrappy information associated with the fact that this weapon could represent a virus that completely changes the DNA structure of any living organism, forcing it to mutate in the most unpredictable way.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_10">
		<text>Spontaneous mutations? What do you think is the correct version of man-made mutants?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_11">
		<text>Are you not, Major? So this information didn't just leak out from somewhere - not over a glass of vodka in a bar. It has recently come to light that the mercenaries have taken an interest in the scientists' findings all of a sudden. I'm not telling you, you know that yourself. In addition remains a mystery such a strong their activity in Pripyat near the lab X-8.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_12">
		<text>Yeah, I've been racking my brain on that question myself. Mercenaries wouldn't just go in there.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_13">
		<text>I mean the same thing. Here's the deal. From the scouts just got a report that they saw one of the blue, which again grated near the "Jubilee" BWC. The guys reckoned he was trying to find the entrance to the Eighth. He was working alone, probably one of the top pros. Weapons and gear are the best. Only the guys did not see: whether he went back from the BWC, most likely it was there to meet the monoliths, although not for sure. So you'd better go check it out.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_14">
		<text>Can't you make contact with him if you don't?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_first_talking_15">
		<text>With the blue one, and you don't have to. You can remove it, just bring it to me, and then I will decide what to do.</text>
    </string>.	
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_second_talking_0">
		<text>The mercenary is dead. A very strange death: doesn't look like a monolith - not a single wound on the body. No anomalies nearby, no mutants encountered either. Here is his PDA.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_second_talking_1">
		<text>You say strange death. All right, let's take note. Well, let's see. Oh, there's mention of a certain Project Source. Interesting, so it's the soul of the group Serbin brought here, it turns out that the mercenaries were looking for something in the lab is related to this project, only it is unclear whether they found or not. The message makes it clear that its sender managed to get there, and that's bad enough. It turns out that the mercenaries were one step ahead of us after all.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_second_talking_2">

	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_sbu_leader_second_talking_3">
		<text>I really hope so. Ok, I need to find out more about this project first. I'll try to run it through our channels. I suggest you interview some of the local custodians. I think they might be able to provide some leads.</text>

		<text>"October 18. ...Around midnight we - a group of scientists captured or recruited at different times and in different parts of the world - were brought to a certain staging post. It was a long journey. Everyone is treated the same. Both those who work for money and those who are intimidated, whose families have been taken hostage. I am scared. The overlay of civility was too thin. At first we, each of us individually, were driven to an animal state by constant threats, public torture and mockery. Some of us could not bear the physical pain. Others, brave enough to talk about their importance in the scientific world and the special services, which would surely save them, snapped and lost hope. In Central Africa, in the temporary staging area where we met for the first time, many perked up. After a long period of isolation, everyone felt much better: we, broken all by ourselves, dreamed that together we would be able to think of a way to escape, or at least to make known the plight in which we found ourselves. The camp is guarded by mercenaries. They are totally unsociable, but subject to brutal discipline. Any breach is punishable by death. I look at them and think: our governments could have had a different policy. Instead of leading the world into ruin and chaos, wasting billions on political intrigue and blatant adventure, they should have been concerned about the general welfare and education of the peoples inhabiting the Earth. After what has been done to me, such thoughts do not seem naive. The senseless abuse to which I have been subjected has not only destroyed my will, but erased many illusions. We are doomed. The world is doomed. I do not know what goals the non-humans who have taken us over have, but they feel they are the absolute masters of the situation. Using the technical achievements of civilisation, they don't give a damn about any of the laws of the civilised world. I am scared. A brute, bestial force breaks the thin walls of consciousness, destroys illusions and creates a persistent sense of hopelessness. I ask myself: why and how was this possible? The answer is simple and floats to the surface: half a century of double standards and blatant double-dealing has created an illusion of impunity for many groups operating under the wings of a number of governments. We ourselves have nurtured a new strain of the plague. A moral plague. This can be seen particularly clearly from here, from the bottom of the abyss into which we have had to fall. October 25th. Keeping a diary. My past horror is nothing compared to what I've just experienced. Our escape plan has been discovered. It turns out there were provocateurs among us. They had thrown everybody out of the barracks and lined us up in the dusty square, then the brutal mercenaries, on the orders of a pale, gaunt, European-looking "gentleman", had thrown every fifth man out of the ranks. They were shot before our eyes. My hands were trembling. I could hardly keep a stump of pencil in my fingers. They were killed without any pity, brutally, with pleasure. The bodies were left lying in the dust, and in a minute flies were swarming over them. I could no longer bear the constant moral pressure, the debilitating fear. The only form of protest I was capable of was these notes. If they are found, I will certainly be killed. It becomes horrible, sometimes I am ashamed of myself. I do not have the strength to die with dignity, throwing myself on the guard - the lust to live is too great in my mind. I don't understand why they need a geneticist. All my life I have devoted to the development of genetically modified plants, only began experiments on animals, grafting representatives of rare, endangered species some inherent qualities, which should help them to survive in the rapidly changing biosphere of the Earth. My resistance has finally been broken. For a year now, the incessant nightmare has continued. There is no more hope." It gets even more interesting from here on.</text>

		<text>"November 14 (approx.) They're taking us somewhere. We are being transported in the filthy hold of an old, breathing ship. The conditions are inhuman. The constant rocking is maddening. The constant torment suggests self-inflicted torture. How much hardship can a person endure? Where is the point beyond which fear disappears, where hope for a mythical salvation ceases to thrive? Among those trapped in the cesspool-like hold I cannot see many familiar faces. Little by little I come to realise that we were being filtered there, in the camp. The number of specialists from different fields of knowledge was evidently too great to begin with. In the course of the elimination process, the toughest of the toughest were eliminated for the edification of the weak. A win-win tactic. No one would think of resisting any longer. Many have fallen into a complete depression. It would seem that if our tormentors are going to use our prisoners for scientific research or experiments, we must not be led into a state of complete apathy, indifference to our own fate. I fear we may be subjected to illegal drugs upon arrival. Not drugs. December. Our agony is over. The ship reaches the port of destination. Where we are and where we will be taken next is an absolute mystery. Fire hoses were lowered into the hold, we were stripped naked, our clothes turned to rags, pieces of soap were thrown in and water was turned on, and we were ordered to clean up. After washing, several mercenaries acted as barbers. We were shaved naked, again treated as if we were animals. Gradually I was beginning to get used to the state of existence. The past life was a dream, a delirium of an inflamed consciousness. Bales of clothes were waiting for us on the deck. Each one picked out his own things. A piercing, cold wind was blowing, so no one had to be whipped. The clothes were clean, worn, but of good quality. I tried to count how many of us were left. It came out that there were about a hundred of us. My consciousness, sobered by the icy wind, began to work again, coming out of the doom-like slumber. I tried to talk to the others, to find out something. The information is scanty and utterly joyless. There is a persistent rumour that we have been brought to one of the countries of the former Soviet Union. I have heard several times the opinion that our captivity and all the abuse we have endured were the work of the KGB. The latter seemed to me doubtful. Each of us has delusions of genius in our heads, but if we are honest and unbiased, we are no more than average experts. There are no geniuses among us. Good performers with a high level of specialized training, capable of picking up and successfully developing a certain idea. No more than that. Considering the scientific potential scattered by the vortex of perestroika and the hard times of the nineties all over the post-Soviet space I am coming to the conclusion that the local special services definitely do not need us. It's scary to think about, but the one advantage of all the countries of the region without exception is practically total powerlessness. It is easy to hide traces of any adventure here. Soon it will be the new year 2000. Millennium is coming. Is the predicted end of the world really coming?" Think about what's been going on.</text>

		<text>And then this: "December 25 (exactly).We were put on buses. The mercenaries are not hiding weapons. The road, at first paved, now resembles a country lane. We look out of the windows in silence. Behind them are bleak, grey landscapes. Winter without snow. Squalid villages drift by. I drifted off to sleep for a while. I woke up to a jolting sensation. Outside the dusk windows of the bus, I could see a chillingly unreal landscape: a dead city, deserted by its people. Our convoy moves slowly along one of the streets. My knowledge of Russian is enough to make out the letters on one of the signs. Street of Heroes of Stalingrad. Rare snowflakes fall from the sky, slowly circling. The mud is frozen, turning into bumps. I look around and everywhere I see signs of a suddenly stopped life, as if someone is projecting similar black and white photographs on the window: gloomy houses with their windows darkened, street lights not working, rusty cars with deflated tyres, shop windows behind which half-empty counters with remains of goods can be seen in the light of bus headlights, snow-covered playgrounds, swings squeaking in the wind, a doll left in a sand-pit... The bus ascends the hill. The contours of some fundamental buildings are vaguely outlined on the horizon. My neighbour, an expert in cybernetics, suddenly leans over and whispers in my ear: - This is the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. I have been visiting it since before the accident. We are now moving through Pripyat, the dead, abandoned city of power engineers. His whisper is scalding. The buses suddenly turn off and suddenly... We are driving down a ramp leading underground. A clammy terror grips me. You can imagine.</text>

		<text>How, did it all really happen?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_shram_first_talking_13">
		<text>Yeah, who knows. Here's more... "Timeless... I don't know how many months or years have passed since we were brought into the old, Soviet-built underground missile complex. The bunker zone, stretching for many kilometres, has become a haven for mind and body, but I have already lost track of time and have no hope for anything else. My hopes of escape or escape melted away as the meaning of the experiments being conducted here became clearer. Those who captured us and keep us underground hate Humanity, despise the civilisation that nurtured them. They are preparing for the apocalypse. The kinds of weapons being developed here surpass the most delusional and fantastic ideas. We're really being used as industrious artisans. Everyone's given a narrow scope of work. I now know that I am engaged in the development of other people's ideas, research stopped somewhere on the brink of a foul. The genetic changes made by the viruses created in the laboratories will spare no one. They serve to utterly annihilate the enemy, but before they perish, humans and certain species of pets, for which genetic virus strains are designed, will be endowed with extraordinary abilities and serve as weapons. The world will perish or change unrecognisably. Take dogs, for example. Here, in the dungeons of the bunker zone, two strains of virus have already been weaponised, altering the sensorics of their "human friends" and endowing them with unusual survivability and hypertrophied fury. Pseudo-dogs exhibit mental powers over an inferior sub-species, the so-called blind dogs, due to the changes they have made to their brain structure. They can control them. I am no longer afraid. I have become an accomplice not just in a crime, but in the preparation of a mass genocide of mankind. I don't understand what those behind the experiments are counting on. Are they so stupid or insane that they hope to survive? In other laboratories I have seen terrifying creatures created from humans. The most terrifying spawn of the experiments are the controllers. They are capable of influencing the psyche of other mutants, gathering them into battle groups. This is INHUMANITY at its most terrifying and cynical."</text>

	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_1_progect_istochnik_shram_first_talking_15">
		<text>And it's a long story, maybe I'll tell you about it sometime later. Here's another listen - the most interesting "Timelessness. I was recently receiving reagents from a warehouse. A few kilometres away from the biology labs, there was a section for physicists. There I met an old man. He seemed vaguely familiar to me, and when we exchanged a few words with him, I was horrified to recognize a young and undoubtedly talented scientist whom I had met in a past life at a conference on synergetics and the formation of related branches of knowledge existing at the interface of different sciences. He did not seem to remember me. He had no personality left. Only the creepy fanaticism of a researcher. He speaks indecipherable, often and inappropriately rattling off incomprehensible terms. It's amazing how I had the courage and patience to talk to him. The creepiest thing is that I have managed to understand that he has almost completed the setup that suppresses a person's personality. Only primitive reflexes remain. He claims that another device being developed by a "related party" can be used to control enemy soldiers whose minds will be suppressed - for the time being, however, within a radius of a dozen kilometres at most. They become obedient, but not to the will of man or controller. They fall under the influence of a second emitter, controlled by a cybernetic system. Timelessness... I fear nothing any more. My life is over. I am morally dead, and physical suffering is no longer frightening. I think of the dead city we rode through once upon a time. Would the whole Earth turn into a vast graveyard, where mutants and cybernetic-led undead would reign? I suffered, feared, clung to life, wriggled like a worm. Now I am dead. My last wish is to do something to prevent the coming catastrophe. Until all the research is complete, until the strains of genetic viruses are brought to the point of stability where they can be put into action with the expectation of a hundred percent result, until the Burner and its mysterious component that controls the behaviour of people who have lost their own minds has passed its final tests, I have to do something. I couldn't live with dignity, but I finally found the strength to die. Releasing all the pseudo dogs and blind dogs in the lab. Might be able to get to the next sector and free some controllers. I've heard that the Exclusion Zone area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is controlled by one of the isolation forces. I hope they are not in collusion with the mercenaries and their masters guarding us. The dogs have broken out of their cages before - nobody will worry much at first, but when the mercenaries understand the scale of what has happened it will be too late. I hope so..."</text>.

However, the project was a fiasco - although experimental subjects get the desired properties, but they become completely uncontrollable. Because of that, the project was shut down and the prototypes and documentation were moved to an unknown location. It is also known that the development was carried out in a class X laboratory.

		<text>Yes, me. Don't be surprised- Beard just made an insurance policy and hired me through intermediaries. Naturally, I didn't engage in combat, just observed.

		<text>I'll start in order. First the good news. Managed to fully establish the objectives of the mercenary activities in Pripyat. There is no doubt they acted by order of "Alpha", here is the listen - the basic essence: "...Center: The basic purpose of a group of sympathizers from the CIA in the Chernobyl Anomaly Zone - data gathering about everything happening there or occurring, and also acting as a safety net for our basic formations. Means and ways of its achievement - any. Squad leader - in this direction we have already achieved a lot: A) we have funded several mercenary squads with different objectives: 1) Mercenary Squad Black - collect information about the research of scientists and simultaneously sabotage their work; 2) Mercenary Squad Serbin and Xavier - search laboratories in Pripyat, etc. B) Work is being done to sabotage the activities of SBU agents in the Zone - according to our data, only one agent - Major Degtyarev, is currently active in the Zone, as well as...</text>

		<text>Well, Major, it's too late to drink borjomi - your kidneys died of radiation long ago. You did not hear the main thing: "According to the current project" S.T.A.L.K.E.R. "to assist Object Zero in introducing trained people from the group" Sin "in the various armed groups permanently operating in the area, as well as in the ranks of ordinary stalkers to sabotage the activities of groups and prevent the advancement of stalkers to our positions. Moreover, despite the seemingly perfect understanding between the forces of Sin and Monolith, cases of cooperation between the latter and our enemies were revealed. Therefore I deem it necessary to secretly introduce a permanent representative of Sin into the Monolith group in order to monitor the activities of the main contingent. Prepare our brothers to carry out a cover operation, if the task will be impossible- destroy the witnesses and prepare a new agent...."</text>.

	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_8">

	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_9">
		<text>Centre intercepted an unknown message from an unknown source. We have only been able to establish the approximate point from which the message was transmitted. It is likely that we will soon be conducting a military operation in that area, but more on that later.</text>

    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_10">
		<text>It appears that Sin, Monolith, Alpha Squad can all work in symbiosis with each other?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_11">
		<text>Most likely. Looks like someone very serious is playing a strange game and has some very strong sectarian figures at their disposal.</text>

	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_12">
		<text>That's it in order: with the blues is clear - who pays, and then work for him, with "Alpha" - it turns out they only insure, and from the outside - they have no direct interest in what is happening, only what benefits the CIA - it turns out also no better than hired guns. That leaves Sin and the Monolith. And although they are linked, but it seems there is no full understanding between them - they would not have introduced a mole of sinners into the "Monolith". Damn, that's a head-scratcher!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_13">
		<text>It turns out someone doesn't have as much confidence in the Monolith sectarians as they used to. Looks like those might have started to get out of hand and needed new equally strong and obedient soldiers.</text>

		<text>Do you think Sin could have been founded by the same people who created Monolith?</text>

	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_15">
		<text>Not really. The Sinners have been around for about a year now-although it used to be a completely different faction-more of a bunch of lunatics than a fighting clan. There were rumors that they were cannibals as well. What do we see now?</text>

    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_16">

	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_17">
		<text>It looks like Sin has been taken over by the new masters and reconstructed the faction, just as they once did with the Monoliths. Only for what purpose. And most importantly - who is behind them?</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_18">
		<text>Yes, the purpose seems clear - the credibility of Monolith has fallen, and you ask who - it's very possibly the work of O-Consciousness.</text>

    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_19">
		<text>"O-Consciousness" seems to have been destroyed by Shooter, although there's no confirmation of that. And why do you think Monolith's credibility might have fallen, since the sectarians successfully repelled the storming of Chernobyl.</text>

    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_20">

		<text>Explain.</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_22">
		<text>When I was trying to find my way to Pripyat, I met a group of monoliths near the Jupiter plant. They showed no aggression, but on the contrary tried to establish contact and asked for help. It seems that before they were held by some kind of psi unit.</text>
    </string>.		
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_23">
		<text>Like Radar?</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_24">
		<text>It's quite possible, just with a different principle of operation. Back when I was working on the main assignment on the Scats with Kowalski I managed to establish that the Monoliths use special repeaters that subdue them.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_25">
		<text>Sounds like you're right, maybe there is a better control option and it's being tested just on sinners.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_26">
		<text>It's not proven-just a theory. But the fact that the monoliths sometimes fail is there.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_27">
		<text>You made sure of that yourself when you came into contact with them.</text>

    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_28">
		<text>What did you say?</text>

	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_29">
		<text>What you heard, Major. Did you think command would not find out that you had had some contact with the monoliths other than combat and even ran some of their errands?</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_30">
		<text>I, yes...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_31">
		<text>All right, forget it Major... You're a former stalker, so you don't refuse to make extra money any way you can. The monoliths were paying, you were fulfilling. But that's lyrical - we even benefit from your contact with the enemy. It comes in handy, otherwise you wouldn't be alive a long time ago. And now to the point - we won't do anything good with our speculation and conjecture, we have to use facts. And they say that the enemy has a lot of forces, but they are not fully united, so we must use them.</text>

    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_32">
		<text>What should I do?</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_33">
		<text>First thing to establish: has Alpha succeeded in infiltrating the sinner into the Monolith. It won't be easy to do, but given your connection to the latter, it's possible. Intelligence reports that another Monolith field commander, Guron, has surfaced in Pripyat. He's one of the most odious figures in the sect. He is engaged exclusively in realization of military operations. Thanks to him the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was defeated and soon Radar and part of the Red Forest were recaptured.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_34">
		<text>And why should I go out with him, wouldn't it be easier to destroy him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_35">
		<text>No, not easy - Guron is in Pripyat not for long - he replenishes the sectarians with new fighters, and most likely the sinner will try to plant them with this very replenishment, so we need to ask Guron about those who they have managed to attract in the group and try to figure out the mole</text>.
    </string>.
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_36">
		<text>And what makes you think Guron will even talk to me-he's not a Eruption and doesn't know anything about anything?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_first_talking_37">
		<text>So about that: you tell Guron that from Said-it's another one of their commanders, even more of a scout-they'll understand. We have learned that Said as well as Guron is replenishing the ranks with new brothers and they have agreed that Guron will send him some men. I think it will work and he will tell you who he has managed to attract to the clan lately. Then you'll meet each of the new recruits and give them these weapons-hold the machine guns and don't lose them- there are bugs in them. We may be able to track down the mole in this way.</text>

	<string id="pri_quest_shpion_2_centr_shertowshini_sbu_leader_second_talking_7">
		<text>Similar, but not quite - sinners are usually more straightforward, and this Anubis seems to have the imagination: brews a lot, and has a lot of connections. But it is not clear who he is. But he has done so much and the clues are minimal.</text>

		<text>Yes, first that adventure with pitting Svoboda and Dolga against mercenaries, then the pseudo-Dolga conspiracy with bandits and the subsequent attack on Skadovsk. But notice that many figures on this Anubis's side were expendable. What do you think of that?</text>

		<text>Sounds like Anubis has something to do with the sinners, but acts more to serve their interests, with everyone supposed to think just the opposite.

		<text>I remember, of course. But what do you mean commanded? Where is he now?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_first_talking_11">
		<text>This is what you're about to find out. His duties on Skadovsk are now performed by me. Beard talked me into it. Sword, on the other hand, disappeared with his group a few days ago. And it doesn't seem to have happened by accident.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_first_talking_12">
		<text>What do you mean?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_first_talking_13">
		<text>It looks like the Sin clan has become active against the locals. Previously, since the sinners appeared in these parts they were limited to local skirmishes with stalkers. But they rarely gathered in large groups and never engaged in open combat - they tried to strike quietly. Active were only their secret agents among other clans and free stalkers. It seems that they are gaining strength and now decided to strike a major blow.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_first_talking_14">
		<text>I've had to deal with them many times before. You're right about that - they've created a whole network of agents that sabotaged the activities of other groups. Also, they were already noted in one major conflict with the Debtors, though we managed to stop the sinners. But I guess it was only a diversionary tactic.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_first_talking_15">
		<text>It seems now they took matters more seriously - at Yanovu generally became a hell of a thing going on - stalkers disappearing one by one, mutants and new patrols of these sinners shot all indiscriminately. "Duty" with "Freedom" and "Dawn" can hardly hold them back. And here, as you can see, they started it too - the Sword is missing. I'm pretty sure it's the work of sinners. So how can you help me try to find it?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_first_talking_16">
		<text>It's worth a try, only it's unlikely he's alive - sinners always finish off enemies, but finding clues about the sinners themselves would be nice.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_first_talking_17">
		<text>That's for sure, because so far we don't know their leaders or goals. You might be able to find something.</text>

		<text>His name is Beetle. I don't think you've met him - he's not from around here. Came from the militia only a week ago. For what business - do not know, but he took great interest in the affairs of the local dealers.</text>

	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_third_talking_4">
		<text>More precisely, into the fire.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_third_talking_5">
		<text>All right, Major, good job - here's your payment. Now leave me alone, I have something to think about. Come and see me tomorrow, we'll decide what to do next.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_1_granit_third_talking_6">
		<text>I'll be in touch.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_0">
		<text>Hey, what did you manage to find out?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_1">
		<text>Yes, Major-- the news is not comforting.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_2">
		<text>What is it?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_3">
		<text>I have become aware of the possible target of the Mecha group. I was informed of it by Nazar, the leader of the Dawn.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_4">
		<text>What, you reported it yourself?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_5">
		<text>No, passed it on through his deputy. He's here on Skadovsk - his name is Legolas. He will help us coordinate our actions against the sinners here on Zaton.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_6">
		<text>What's on Jupiter?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_7">
		<text>It's not so bad there - the mercenaries destroyed a large underground warehouse in Kopachi, supplying the group, and the "Duty" with the "Dawn" defeated a squad of sinners near the Karier. Things are much worse for us.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_8">
		<text>So what about the Sword?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_9">
		<text>Unfortunately, in all this confrontation with the sinners, we lack one thing - detailed information about the group's goals and objectives. The only major field commander Ibis was killed by you recently, and there were no other opportunities to track down their leaders. Even the military in Pripyat is deaf about it.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_10">
		<text>Yeah, the SSU has already searched half of the Zone, so far to no avail. Anubis doesn't really count, there are some separate points about him. Several more of their pawns, such as Warg, Puppeteer, we also destroyed. We can only hope that the sinners themselves will be punctured and reveal the cards.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_11">
		<text>Or they'll make a move, which is more likely. Okay, now about the Sword: it was recently reported that sinners are practically immune to psi influence from the outside. Found out about it by accident. Scientists, on the other hand, are shaking their hands, saying we don't have a clue. Only Nazar thought that it can not just be.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_12">
		<text>I've known before that most likely the sinners are controlled by the same ones who hold the monoliths, only affecting them in a different way.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_13">
		<text>Probably. But that's our only clue for now. We need to look for this new way of control.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_14">
		<text>And as I understand the Sword was doing just that.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_15">
		<text>Yes, when he was on Janova, he met with all the local clan leaders. Listened to all their theories and came to the conclusion that the sectarians were most likely influenced by some kind of special psi artifacts.</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_16">
		<text>Who told him that?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_17">
		<text>That's what Nazar thought. That's why he gave the Sword a group of his men. Besides Loki agreed to help him.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_18">
		<text>And I've put that bastard Beetle in the group.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_19">
		<text>No, Beetle nailed it afterwards. Loki, on the other hand, organized a second group to work in parallel with the Sword group. It consisted of a few Dawnlings and five Freemen.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_20">
		<text>And where was it supposed to be?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_21">
		<text>Here, on the Zaton. Both groups were advancing on their routes, trying to find some leads.</text> 
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_22">
		<text>What makes you think that what you're looking for is right here in Zaton?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_23">
		<text>There have been several times where stalkers have stumbled upon solitary sinners. And it couldn't just be that. These sinners were clearly looking for something. After all, even their scouting groups go in fives, but these were alone. So everyone agreed that this is where the search should start.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_24">
		<text>OK, what can I do now?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_25">
		<text>Lately, the connection with the second group of allies has also disappeared. They may have also suffered the fate of the Sword, but you'd better talk to Legolas about it, he'll tell you what to do.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_granit_first_talking_26">
		<text>Good.</text>.
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_0">
		<text>Hello, I'm Major Degtyarev, SBU. Investigating the aftermath of the Sin group here in order to suppress this activity. I'm from Granit. He said you might have something to report.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_1">
		<text>I am Legolas. Nazar's deputy. I've heard a lot about you. You've helped our clan and all the free stalkers in the Zone. Didn't think we'd have to work together, but whatever. What's your opinion on what Granite told you?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_2">
		<text>Certainly there's something to this. And in the absence of other leads, we'll work on a version of controlling sinners from outside. Only I think we need to look a little differently and not here.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_3">
		<text> So you agree that the sinners, like the Monolith, are under psi control, only of a slightly different kind and not related to natural artefacts. Then what kind of control do you think it is?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_4">
		<text>So it is. And the type of control can vary widely. From psi-pumping to direct suggestion from outside, either directly or via repeaters, like with the Monolith.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_5">
		<text>Why aren't you taking the artifact version seriously?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_6">
		<text>What kind of artifact could it be that only one faction knows about it and no one has ever found it? No, it's something else.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_7">
		<text>But if that's the case, then both groups wouldn't be missing, and you've already established that it was the sinners who killed Mecha. Isn't that proof that we're looking in the right direction?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_8">
		<text>No, they want to lead us astray. They're counting on us to buy the destruction of these search parties and keep digging in the same direction. And believe me it will be to no avail.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_9">
		<text>Then what do you suggest?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_10">
		<text>Nothing so far. But I have an idea, or rather I think I know another possible not the last person in their faction.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_11">
		<text>With Anubis you thought so at first too.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_12">
		<text>And how do you all know about Anubis?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_13">
		<text>My friend, people like him don't just appear in the Zone. These people become legends of the Zone. Remember the Strelka, for instance? Anubis didn't just show up, trust me.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_14">
		<text>I believe it, but I'll get it out of the ground anyway. So, about the second group, what do you want to do?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_15">
		<text>Search for them. But I have no illusions, there is little hope that they are alive. My people are here in the Zaton, they will help the neutral stalkers. Yes, and I think the "freedom" will not stand aside.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_first_talking_16">
		<text>Specifically, what do you know about them?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_first_talking_17">
		<text>In the Staircase you have to look for them first. They were there the last time I managed to contact them. Only you're not going there alone. Granite and I have assembled a group of different clan stalkers against the sinners, so you won't have to go it alone now. Now get to the Port Cranes- Klen and Thorus are waiting for you there. The Freedom Stalkers will come a little later, all Major, see you there.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_first_talking_18">
		<text>Goodbye.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_0">
		<text>Hello, Major. Looks like we have one more task to complete.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_1">
		<text>Kleen, the vagabond. Survived the meat grinder, though.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_2">
		<text>What did you think? We nailed those thugs so hard, they wouldn't come out of their noses. But now the task is more serious.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_3">
		<text>Yes, I see. The Rassvetians are good, they don't leave their own behind. Okay, what's the point.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_4">
		<text>Looks like this - the last time the group made contact was from the Ladder Territory. You know, after Chapaev was kicked out of there Forestry became the most convenient car park in the area. Now there are always free people, or someone else hanging around, no beasts, no anomalies. And suddenly, in broad daylight, a group disappears.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_5">
		<text>Shall we move out now?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_6">
		<text>Yeah, those guys led by Thorus and the freedom fighters sent us a small squad - they just came out of Skadovsk now, they'll be coming up soon. Hannibal is their leader.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_7">
		<text>What other instructions?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_8">
		<text>Me and the scouts take the road and immediately take up defence at the west gate, Torus-you and yours can go directly through the bumps to the south entrance. And don't let anyone in from the other side. You, Major, stay better with us, on arrival with Hannibal's men, you'll survey the area. All right, let's go.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_klen_first_talking_9">
		<text>No fluff.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_0">
		<text>Fucking hell, what a massacre. Who the hell did this to them? Didn't leave a mark, either. Their guns are almost clean - they probably didn't even have time to fire a single shot.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_1">
		<text>Yes, that was what Legolas had feared the most. Damn, another failure.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_2">
		<text>It feels like they've been hit over the head with a dust bag. Maybe there's a controller around, or maybe they're psionics. Can't you feel anything?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_3">
		<text>Yeah, and yours must have been taken out by the zombies the same controller brought in. Bullshit. People took them down. They all had firearms. But they were hit with different calibers, mostly 5.45s, and some shotgun wounds. More like bandits, only they'd never be able to get up close and personal like that.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_4">
		<text>Maybe the sinners? I mean, they're doing an all-out expansion right now.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_5">
		<text>Maybe. One thing that is clear is that the group was hit first with a powerful psi-strike and then finished off the helpless, almost at point-blank range.</text> 
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_6">
		<text>Yeah, stuff...Shit, wait...someone's on the phone....</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_7">
		<text>What is it? ....</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_8">
		<text>...yes, I see...Major-Legolas reported a large bandit formation spotted by Skadovsk Intelligence. They're coming towards us from the Port Cranes and the Preobrazhensky Bridge. We must take up defensive positions immediately.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_9">
		<text>The creatures want to ring, but how did they know we were here?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_10">
		<text>All, Major, we can not delay...then we will discuss everything with Legolas, if we stay alive...fighters...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_gannibal_first_talking_11">
		<text>Here we go...</text>.
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolast_second_talking_0">
		<text>The adjacent group is destroyed, we are attacked by bandits. Maple is killed.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_1">
		<text>Damn it. I should have seen this coming. Hannibal and Thorus are they...?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_2">
		<text>It seems to have survived - stayed put. It's all very strange. A group of Svoboda's adversaries were shot at point-blank range. Most likely they were hit by a powerful psi hit. They didn't stand a chance. Immediately after we discovered them we were attacked by bandits.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_3">
		<text>Where did they come from? I thought you had them under Skadovskiy. You did not notice anything strange in their attack?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_4">
		<text>They probably didn't want to attack us. I think they fell under someone else's control too, as they attacked us incessantly and didn't count their losses.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_5">
		<text>The situation is familiar. Bandits never go off like this - to certain death. Which tactic looks more like "Monolith" or "Sin". Most likely the sinners let them go ahead for the slaughter as a diversionary tactic. They themselves struck a little later.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_6">
		<text>But surely someone ratted us out, they couldn't have just attacked?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_7">
		<text>We couldn't. But we don't know who did. Looks like you were right about something. They're really trying to drag us down a false trail. Now they're hoping we'll reassemble a large unit and send them on their way after the last one.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_8">
		<text>What do you suggest?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_9">
		<text>Me, nothing so far. But I've just been contacted by a Torogian from Janova. He said he had some information.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_10">
		<text>Do you think it's worth checking out?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_11">
		<text>Yes, go to Janov. I think Thorus can handle it here for now. If not, we'll send more men.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_2_legolas_second_talking_12">
		<text>I got it. I'll be there soon.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_0">
		<text>Hello, Hawaiian. Legolas tells me you have business with me.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_1">
		<text>Truly my friend. It's about our common misfortune, the Sin clan.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_2">
		<text>Do you know anything in particular?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_3">
		<text>We can say that yes. A group of free walkers from the southern Zone showed up here on Janova the other day. They're in charge of the World One. They bought cartridges and food for several days from me. I asked them, as usual, what plans they have for the near future, and whether they need any help or advice. Guys are not local, and probably do not know that we have as it is not safe, and in recent times even more.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_4">
		<text>Well, what do sinners have to do with it?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_5">
		<text>You keep listening. The peacekeeper says, "We are not here by chance, Nazar hired us. I told him why he doesn't need any volunteers, if he's already got enough people. Nearly half of the locals have joined them in the last month. And he told me: Nazar's job is that a group is needed.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_6">
		<text>What's the task?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_7">
		<text>Act. Anyway World said- Nazar wants to test one theory about possible control of sinners from outside.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_8">
		<text>Well, there you go. What's next?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_9">
		<text>World with his own gone. And as they say with the ends. I informed Loki of this. His men followed the group for a while, then stopped. Loki said, "Fuck that, they've already fuckin' killed fuckin' people on Zaton, and it's no use. We couldn't find any psi artifacts there anyway. So me that's what it seems that no artifacts do not exist, but Nazar really became aware of the truth in the matter with the sinners.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_10">
		<text>I think I'll ask him myself. I wonder if he's not being subtle. After all, as Granit said Nazar put forward a version of the artifacts.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_11">
		<text>You ask, just one more thing. The World group seems to be the same as on Zaton the Sword with the Svobodavs. Oh, this is not a clean case...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_gavaetc_first_talking_12">
		<text>OK, thanks for the tip.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_0">
		<text>Well, hello, Nazar. Anything you want to explain to me?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_1">
		<text>What do you mean, Major?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_2">
		<text>I'm talking about your sinners binge. Like, they have psi artifacts. Two groups have already gone down on Zaton. And half of them were your people. And then I find out you've assembled another group from the outside. Do you know what for?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_3">
		<text>That's it, Major, don't be fuming. It all makes sense to me now. I'll explain everything.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_4">
		<text>Try harder.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_5">
		<text>It looks like I've really managed to hit the right trail. And a group of Worlds was hired by me precisely to test it. As for the artifact version, I've never put it forward myself and I think it's utter nonsense...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_6">
		<text>Wait, what about...because Granit said...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_7">
		<text>Granit came up with it himself. And he persuaded me to support the idea. Now I found out that he was stupidly setting me up - he passed his words off as my own. That's why we're on the wrong track and we've already killed two groups. Because of Granite, not me - trust me.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_8">
		<text>That's how it is, and the World. What do you need him for?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_9">
		<text>I had an idea. That someone really is controlling the sinners. Except that it's hardly a matter of any special artefacts. I talked to Garin, he consulted with the scientists, as to whether this is possible. They say we do not know how, but heard that the Americans have managed to create a drug that allows you to increase a person's psi threshold. I don't quite understand it. It also allows one to perceive mental orders from outside without any pain or damage to the basic brain activity. That is to be simultaneously a normal human being and at the same time remain a soulless zombie doing someone else's will.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_10">
		<text>Fucking hell, why didn't you share your insights before. So what's the world supposed to know then?"</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_11">
		<text>Listen, friend. Of course, I understand that you need the information and stuff, but I also need to benefit from it. So far, it's been nothing but losses for the faction. We're not "The Debt" or "Liberty" to be giving away combat quads left and right. So, already at least a dozen of my men have died because of my miscalculation with the Granite.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_12">
		<text>It's your own fault, you could have suspected something fishy about that stalker. Okay, what do you want?</text>
    </string>

		<text>If you can do one favor for the clan, I'll tell you what the group of Worlds did and how to use it against the sinners. How's that for you?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_14">
		<text>I agree.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_15">
		<text>My faction is slowly gaining strength. We're trying not to hole up in the tunnel and get devoured by mutants or mauled by sinners. Gradually my people are moving toward Zaton, and increasingly active patrolling the adjacent territory and assisting other stalker clans in the struggle against the "Sin" and "Monolith" sectarians. But there remains one unresolved issue that is simply vital to the stalkers of any clan. Unfortunately Legolas is now on Zaton and did not have time to finish what he started, so this problem to the end you'll solve.</text>.

	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_16">
		<text>What do I have to do?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_17">
		<text>You will need to create group caches at some key points. Our stalkers have become well-equipped, but now all sorts of situations arise. So without common hiding places, staffed with everything you need, you can't. Legolas marked the places of future hiding places, but did not have time to fill them. So it must be done soon.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_18">
		<text>What's to pack? A gas mask and a AK will suffice?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_19">
		<text>Do we look like losers with AKs? So, the cache will fill as follows: stock of medicines and food, I think on one military medical kit and Drypayku will be enough; weapon-there's your choice you want to lay there our Russian or the same natovskih, but not the old AKM and not M16. With uniforms, there is only our special Dawn armored suits and helmets. PC-2 or PC-3b will do just fine. And an anomaly detector. I think Veles will do. All should lay five caches, as you do all discuss the further situation with the sinners.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_20">
		<text>And where am I supposed to find so many of your armour and helmets? And the rest, not worth five rubles.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_21">
		<text>What a cheapskate you are, Major. About the uniforms - when you leave the base you go along the railway before the fork in Janov, turn left, there's a small ravine, it is our common temporary hiding place. There is a part of a necessary outfit, as well as artifacts, and money that you can spend on not enough.</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_first_talking_22">
		<text>Got it, I'll be back when I do.</text>

	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_second_talking_0">
		<text>All, Nazar, your caches are filled with everything you need. Now say everything you know.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_second_talking_1">
		<text>Thank you, Major, for your help, as far as the Mirny group is concerned: as I have learned from his reports, the sinners use a special psi drug. I do not know anything about its action and purpose. But it seems to be exactly what we were looking for. The world has learned that the drug is supplied by people funded from overseas. Namely the Alpha unit. The leader of the sinners, who controls the supply of drugs is called Demonolog - it seems he is one of the most important figures in their clan. Stalker also learns that the Demonologo has a meeting planned with "Alpha" in the near future.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_second_talking_2">
		<text>Location and time?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_second_talking_3">
		<text>For the Zaton north of the Sawmill. I think you know where that is. Legolas will assist you. There has been no further contact from the world. Most likely the sinners found his group and killed them all, but his PDA signal can still be picked up. So get over there. I still haven't heard the last report from Peacekeeper. I think he has something in his PDA for you.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_second_talking_4">
		<text>Okay, I'll find his band.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_second_talking_5">
		<text>And Major, once you find the Worldly, you don't have to come to me anymore - go straight to the Zaton to Legolas, he will now coordinate the Dawn against the sinners. I'm the reason those two groups on Zaton are dead. He's in charge of all that spy stuff now. As for me, our people will always help in any way they can, no matter where it's needed.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_second_talking_6">
		<text>But you were set up by Granite, it's not your fault the stalkers died. And Granite, if met, will get what he deserves.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_second_talking_7">
		<text>If only you can find him. Legolas informed me that as soon as you left for Janov, Granite disappeared somewhere, he seems to be a sinner himself and now you'll only get him if you get him in combat. If you manage to get through to the clan leaders, there's going to be a full-blown faction war with the sectarians. The same thing that happened two years ago in the days of Clear Skies may happen. We will, as I said, support those who will stand up against the sectarians. You, on the other hand, discuss it with Shulga and Loki later. "Duty and Liberty will fight that's for sure, only they'll probably be afraid to enter enemy territory and will limit themselves to expelling them from their immediate vicinity. They don't want a repeat of the carnage that occurred in Pripyat and under the walls of Chernobyl, when Strelok cut off the incinerator. You will need to enlist their support and convince them to go all the way.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_nazar_second_talking_8">
		<text>I will learn about it. First, this war must be waged.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_legolas_first_talking_0">
		<text>Legolas, I have some good news. I managed to find what we were looking for.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_legolas_first_talking_1">
		<text>Yes, I already know - Nazar told me everything. Well, then it will be necessary to attack the Demonologist during their meeting with the "Alpha".</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_legolas_first_talking_2">
		<text>Already after talking to Nazar, I found the PDA of the stalker he hired, here take a look. Here is all the information regarding the sinners. The most interesting and inexplicable is that most likely, and some particularly clever mutants have had a hand, or whatever they have in all this mess - boron.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_legolas_first_talking_3">
		<text>It sure is a hell of a thing, Major. Looks like someone too serious is behind the sectarians. New mutants that have only just appeared. Psionics who are helping these sinners, their joint action with the Monolith and foreign units. These special agents like Anubis...</text>
	</string>.
    <string id="all_greh_quest_3_legolas_first_talking_4">
		<text>I believe this is the work of the O-Consciousness, or whatever they've become since their ranks were thinned by Shooter. I've never been able to get a coherent explanation for what's become of them. And Anubis himself had told me to turn back. They're no match for me.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_legolas_first_talking_5">
		<text>All right, Major, don't bother. The main thing now is to stop the Sin sectarians. The rest, as it goes. So, I'll send the scouts and a few experienced stalkers who have agreed to help us to the Sawmill. They'll have to let me know when the Sinners and the Alpha come into their sights. Wait for the night, they will inform.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_legolas_first_talking_6">
		<text>Well, what do you think of Granite?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_legolas_first_talking_7">
		<text>Bitch he is. Not a sinner, by any means. Sounds like he's just trying to work for them, so he's breaking in his own. I reckon they'll do him in, and if not, we'll do him.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_3_legolas_first_talking_8">
		<text>OK, I'll be in touch.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_0">
		<text>Comrade Colonel, I have good news.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_1">
		<text>Let me guess which ones. Have you succeeded in destroying all the sinners on Zaton?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_2">
		<text>With your help, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. "The Duty has greatly helped the simple stalkers from Skadovsk get rid of the threat of the sectarians.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_3">
		<text>Yeah. However, we managed to achieve quite a bit. Many of their field commanders and spirit guides have been killed, including the Demonologist. Disrupted the supply of their psi drugs. Destroyed their large base on the ship "Taras Shevchenko", destroyed psionics, affecting their leaders. Yes, we have something to be proud of. But it is not enough.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_4">
		<text>That's right. It has come to my attention that another equally odious leader of the sinners, Osiris, is now here in the vicinity of Jupiter.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_5">
		<text>Yes, that thing is here. But we'll nail him soon, too. Most of the sinners are now clustered around the Jupiter factory. It's a large unit that holds the key checkpoint at the intersection of important roads, and they also control the Container Depot to the west of the factory. Therefore, before attempting an assault on their main base at Jupiter, it is necessary to eliminate the sinners at two key points. Nazar and I have agreed to attack the Container Depot together, and then advance on Jupiter. The mercenaries will also be on hand to help us retake the factory. Loki, on the other hand, promised to deal with those at the checkpoint.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_6">
		<text>This is good, only a raid into Pripyat is just necessary later on. The main leader of the sinners Hades is hiding there, possibly Anubis is also there now, and if we don't strike a blow to their lair, then all our successes here will go to waste. With the help of the monoliths the sinners will gather strength in Pripyat, and strike again. So can I count on the help of the Dolg in the raid on Pripyat?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_7">
		<text>All right, Degtrev, we agree. Although our previous raid into the city nearly ruined the faction, we'll support you.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_8">
		<text>Agreed. Nazar agrees too, all that's left is to convince Loki.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_9">
		<text>Talk to him right now and tell his men to start attacking the checkpoint, if they manage to take control of the crossroads, me and the Dawners will launch an immediate assault on the sinners' positions.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_shulga_first_talking_10">
		<text>I get it, after the Liberty and I take over the checkpoint I will advance to the point to connect with your quads.</text>

		<text>Hello, Hannibal, do you have any information about the enemy forces stationed at the checkpoint area?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_gannibal_first_talking_2">
		<text>Yes, Major. Anyway, my scouts have reported that there's now some sort of council of field commanders of the Sin clan gathered at the checkpoint. About five people, and the actual clan fighters guarding the commanders are not much. Best time to strike now.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_gannibal_first_talking_3">
		<text>Well, they don't really need security. Again, all in the exa with gausses on their shoulders. Against such a tank one on one really can not go.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_gannibal_first_talking_4">
		<text>Oh, who's to say. How many of those did you take down on Zaton? That's right, so we'll get through it. But that's not all. The main squads of sinners are patrolling that area now, so once there's a firefight at the checkpoint, we'll have to wait for the guests. They won't have time to get there right away, but they will, so it's important to take out all the sinners at the checkpoint as quickly as possible and have time to fortify yourself in order to repel their patrols' counterattacks.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_gannibal_first_talking_5">
		<text>We will. As soon as it's done, I'm moving out to the control point immediately for a further offensive with the Debtors.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_gannibal_first_talking_6">
		<text>We're not going any further with you, Major. There's been no orders from my superiors. I think the "Duty" with the "Dawn" will take care of it. If only, when you get to "Jupiter" we'll help, but maybe not, we rush straight to Pripyat.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_7_gannibal_first_talking_7">

    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_4_anurak_first_talking_2">

    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_4_anurak_first_talking_4">

	<string id="all_greh_quest_4_riys_first_talking_3">
		<text>I'll check anyway. And you and the guys pull up to Skadovsk afterwards, I don't think the sinners will just leave it at that. Looks like we finally started a war today, Lynx.</text>

    </string>.
	<string id="zat_stalker_shram_precondition_hack_pda_talking_3">
		<text>I'll help you get them, only you'll have to work for me first. Run my errands, and then we'll talk.</text>
    </string>

		<text>Goodbye.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_0">
		<text>So what are the instructions now?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_1">
		<text>And what do you think they might be Major, we have to finish the creatures off and chase them away from the Zaton.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_2">
		<text>Don't you think they'll get the hell out of here on their own? After all, we managed to destroy most of their forces.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_3">
		<text>No, the Debtors were not lazy to examine the corpses. Allarich told me afterwards that there was no Demonologist among the murdered sinners. And if he is alive, he will try to attack us again. Only we won't wait for that.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_4">
		<text>Anything specific on the Demonologue?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_5">
		<text>Yes, a thought flashed through here the day before, and now it has been fully confirmed. So listen: despite this defeat, the sinners are still too strong, and as proof of this, they have decided to hold a kind of meeting very close to Skadovsk.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_6">
		<text>What's the rally?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_7">
		<text>The Lynx reported that the scouts saw small groups of sinners of three, four people making their way towards the Shevchenko ship throughout last night. And among them they managed to discern someone familiar.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_8">
		<text>And who?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_9">
		<text>These stalkers were considered by many to be hermits, they were known in the southern Zone, but later these men marked violent crimes against ordinary stalkers. Sargeant, the half-mad Imp, who murdered walkers in cold blood, and Screw</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_10">
		<text>Is he the one who tried to kill the Swamp Doctor?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_11">
		<text>Yes, that's the one. They're all sinners now. And agree, they are unlikely to converge on the ship for nothing.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_12">
		<text>So what are we waiting for, shall we hit...</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_13">
		<text>Wait, Major, you're not going in there alone. Allarich has taken his Debtors and Torus the Dawnbreakers to Janov, and Anurak will also be with them for some time, but you have other company.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_14">
		<text>And who, if it's not a secret?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_15">
		<text>Hemul, you may have heard of such a stalker. He and his men will be approaching Skadovsk soon.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_16">
		<text>Yes, the famous stalker. And how on earth did he end up here?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_17">
		<text>The same as you - come to kill the sinners. More specifically, to avenge the sectarians for killing veteran Ivan Taiga, who was in the same clan as Hemul.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_18">
		<text>Are you suggesting we attack together?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_ayaks_first_talking_19">
		<text>Naturally, go he's waiting for you.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_0">
		<text>So, are you the same SBU Major who has been stirring up the entire northern Zone lately?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_1">
		<text>Are you the Hemul, then? Didn't think I'd meet.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_2">
		<text>Yeah, something about your face is familiar to me, weren't you a stalker before?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_3">
		<text>There was a case, only in the past, now I'm only official.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_4">
		<text>I see. Right, then, straight to the point. Coon and Yankel have just returned from a reconnaissance trip. As we supposed, ship "Shevchenko" now controlled by sinners. Not many people, about twenty...</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_5">
		<text>That's it? Looks like we nibbled them pretty good the other day.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_6">
		<text>Heard, sorry we didn't make it to that barbecue, but I assure you those twenty are more than enough. There aren't many ordinary rank-and-file sinners among them. Mostly all known odious murderers. And there's probably a Demonologist among them.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_7">
		<text>Yes, they can't be missed now, when else will they all come together like this?</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_8">
		<text>Nevermore, all perform...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_hemul_first_talking_9">
		<text>performance...</text>.
    </string>
	
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_0">
		<text>Legolas, I have good news. My stalkers and I have wiped out a lot of sinful leaders. Demonologist, also killed.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_1">
		<text>Great, really Hemul has already beaten you to it. He gave me all the details while you were getting here.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_2">
		<text>He's a bogeyman - he beat me to it. Oh, by the way, here's the Demonologist's PDA.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_3">
		<text>What did you think, he's been trampling the Zone for six years for a reason. Only pity he can't help us any more. Said they urgently need to Militar, so now you are unlikely to meet him in the near future.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_4">
		<text>Whatever. Well, looks like we've cleared the Zaton of sinners. I think we should head for Janov's.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_5">
		<text>Yeah, and hurry up. Looks like the faction has all their main forces there and not letting them take Janov's station is our priority. And also talk to the leaders of the "Dolg" and "Liberty". I think they'll coordinate the clans against the sinners. And try to convince them of the need to go to Pripyat.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_6">
		<text>But then we are not only at war with the sinners, but also with the Monolith.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_7">
		<text>The masons will certainly not abandon the sinners, only they won't want to forfeit their positions and are unlikely to take active action. After all, they have also suffered under Chernobyl. So to scatter their forces to help sinners, they will not.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_8">
		<text>Do you think they'll just watch?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_9">
		<text>No, they will fight, but not the whole thing. If we wipe out most of the sinners, the monoliths won't want any further carnage. They've got enough military right now.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="all_greh_quest_6_legolas_first_talking_10">
		<text>All right, I'll talk to Shulga first, I think "The Debt" won't refuse to help.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="zat_stalker_shram_shpion_3_first_talking_0">
		<text>Listen, do you know if anyone suspicious has come to Skadovsk lately?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_shram_shpion_3_first_talking_1">
		<text>Well there were a few people, why? Did something happen?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_shram_shpion_3_first_talking_2">
		<text>Yes, our contact was killed.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_shram_shpion_3_first_talking_3">
		<text>Shit, it's certainly bad news, and there's no one else to even think about. There don't seem to be any accomplices to the sinners who know about your actions on Skadovsk. Wait a minute though, a libertarian came by the court yesterday. Stayed a short time, did not talk to anyone, bought one soup from the Beard and left.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_stalker_shram_shpion_3_first_talking_4">
		<text>Freedomlord...maybe it's an old acquaintance of mine?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_shram_shpion_3_first_talking_5">
		<text>Anubis? Unlikely, he disappeared from the Freedom clan just as Varg died.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_shram_shpion_3_first_talking_6">
		<text>I'm not sure he's completely cut ties with the Freemen. The mercenaries recently caught Anubis' associates in Freedom. They were executed at the Jupiter plant. I think he's decided to get his revenge...</text>

		<text>Let's start in order. First, you helped the Debtors destroy the supposedly mercenary-controlled weapons depot and Freedom, then I coordinated your actions in the elimination of especially zealous Debtors, then you took out Warg, who, as you understand was just a sinner infiltrated the "Debt". You helped Loki a lot, and speaking of Loki, I wish we'd worked more closely together. Helped me in everything...</text>.

		<text>Wait, after you ruined the hopes of all the local bros to take control of Skadovsky, wiped out several groups of new brutes, cleared the Zone of zombies, and killed many of my men. Well, it looks like you've done enough to get yourself shot, but I'm not gonna do that. Instead, I'm gonna let you go, Major, while you got a chance, stay out of my way, it's not your game.</text>

		<text>Speak, now listen. Anubis is only human, albeit one with a mutant congenital handicap, a mutant that is. A very powerful psionic, that's all. You don't have to make up anything super cool. It's not that bad, Major. You managed to find out who he's most likely tied up with and who we're up against after all.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_8">
		<text>Not Sin, not Monolith, not Alpha, but O-Consciousness.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_9">
		<text>Yes, Major. To be honest we've suspected this for a long time. Only we relied on the information of the shooter, who left the Zone along with the "Scat" group.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_10">
		<text>He said he destroyed the O-Consciousness.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_11">
		<text>There is no confirmation of this. He may have killed some of them, but not all of them. And besides, it was reported from HQ that Shooter disappeared again, and a day later he was supposedly seen in the Borderlands. You say, just for fun.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_12">
		<text>No, and Anubis hinted that Shooter had gone into the Zone again.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_13">
		<text>Why are we racking our brains, Major. You yourself seem to have found documents to prove that Shooter, Scar and a few other no lesser-known individuals were participants in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experiment, which was apparently conducted by O-Consciousness. Therefore we cannot fully trust them, because we do not know what the essence of this experiment is. But this is all lyric, we will figure it out later and not us. We have a new task from HQ Major.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_14">
		<text>What again?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_15">
		<text>Not again, but again. So it's like this. It seems that all that happened just that with Anubis spurred the enemy into action. Before that, it was just flowers and local skirmishes. Now the sinners have unleashed their hands and launched a war against the rest of the clans. Unspokenly they are supported by the Monolith. So the main thing now is to stop the "sin" at all costs. Go to the Zaton, there to meet with the new commander of the Stalkers on the "Skadovsk. And you begin to act.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_16">
		<text>Anything else?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="zat_stalker_sbu_shpion_3_first_talking_17">
		<text>Not yet. I think you've had enough of these worries. And I'll dig in about O-Consciousness for now, they can't be discounted either. Obviously Sin will act at their behest, but I don't think they're all-powerful enough to be invincible. All right, so long.</text>

		<text>Which one?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_first_talking_3">
		<text>Military. They did manage to get wind of our relay installations and are now trying to locate and study them.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_first_talking_4">
		<text>Are there not just installations like this in the city?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_first_talking_5">
		<text>Yes, my brother. One of our bases used to be on Zaton, at the Waste Treatment Station. But we left there about a year ago. The repeaters were demanted and safely hidden inside the station's equipment. Eh, why didn't we think of destroying them then....</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_first_talking_6">
		<text>And now what?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_first_talking_7">
		<text>Now the goblins are preparing an operation to find this equipment. I don't know where they got the information about our old base. Maybe it was the mercenaries, I heard one of their troops was looking for something particularly carefully there in the station, maybe someone else tried, but the fact remains - the goblins have established a raid in the area, and we need to stop them.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_first_talking_8">
		<text>I agree to stop them, what should I do?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_first_talking_9">
		<text>Okay, Cyborg has partially already taken care of this operation by sending a squad of our saboteurs, led by Janissary, to the Zaton. Go to Zaton and talk to him. I think your joint action will ensure our success.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_first_talking_10">
		<text>I'll do it.</text>

    </string>
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_second_talking_2">
		<text>We're a little late. The technicians have already occupied the building, though they haven't been able to find anything yet, but it's only a matter of time.</text>.

		<text>What do you propose?</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_second_talking_4">
		<text>Let's do this: take these charges, set them up when I drop you a signal and the coordinates of the detonation points, now let's move out while the goblins aren't so numerous. They have possible air support, but we will try to take it upon ourselves, so your main task is to place mines. When you do it, go far away from the station, it'll blow up like hell. Charges- we'll set in motion.</text>

		<text>question, brother.</text>
    </string>

		<text>Why did you, knowing that I am associated with the military, allow me into your ranks?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_monolith_quest_fall_of_black_eagle_third_talking_5">
		<text>There was an order from above not to interfere with you. It didn't come from Cyborg or Guron. I cannot tell you who it came from. But soon you will know the truth, I promise. Now go....</text>

    <string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_0">
		<text>I have good news, Comrade Colonel.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_1">
		<text>Well, what have you got there, Major?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_2">
		<text>The Sinners' covenant is broken up at Zaton and around Janov Station. Their leaders the Demonologist and Osiris are dead. The latter, however, repented of his sins before his death and helped me get some documents on the real activities of their sect.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_3">
		<text>What a sinner's repentance, funny, give me what you managed to find.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_4">
		<text>Here you go.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_5">
		<text>So, well. Looks like the game has actually taken a more serious turn than we thought. So the O-Consciousness hasn't been destroyed like Shooter told us before. That's too bad. So not only the Monolith, but Sin is now under the control of this mysterious organization. That's what we were afraid of. But for now we have more pressing matters to attend to.</text>
    </string>.	
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_6">
		<text>I think so too. The sinners lost most of their forces on Zaton and Jupiter. Another large unit I destroyed in the Pripyat-1 overpass.</text>
    </string>.	
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_7">
		<text>The rest of their forces, however, have occupied the city. The Monoliths are giving them substantial support, and we have the necessary forces to wage war with two sectarian clans at once...</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_8">
		<text>Probably already is. I managed to convince the leaders of the stalker clans to unite against the sinners.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_9">
		<text>Yes, I know that. Their small assault squads arrived in Pripyat a few hours ago. But unfortunately there is no unity among them. They have scattered alone all over the city, trying to dislodge the sectarians from key points, but there is no communication with them, so I can assume that the scattered action has led to their deaths. That's why you need to look into the matter. You are an experienced saboteur, and I think you will be able to do it.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_10">
		<text>What will my task be?</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_11">
		<text>The main sectarian forces are now converging on the Jubilee BWC. It seems that the head of the sinners, Hades, is based there. But there's no way to get through there yet, so we need to clear the rest of the city of sectarians first. We need to take key positions and destroy their patrols. Get out there now. We'll strike at their core once the city is clean and then, after the final defeat of the sinners, we'll decide what to do with the damn O-Consciousness.</text>
    </string>.	
    <string id="pri_sbu_colloner_all_greh_quest_11_talking_12">
		<text>Done</text>.
    </string>
    
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_0">
		<text>Mayor, I surrender. Don't shoot!</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_1">
		<text>Oops... No, I guessed you were Osiris, but I wasn't entirely sure.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_2">
		<text>Lis is my real name. Even before I was one of the leaders of the sinners and was a simple stalker in the South cordon. Magpie, Flint, Osiris is nothing...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_3">
		<text>And so are you. So are we going to cut your throat right away, or should we talk first?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_4">
		<text>I don't care. My life ended the day I was captured by the sectarians of the still old Sin clan and forced to taste human blood. After that I became one of them, but I found the strength to go back...</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_5">
		<text>Some kind of Darth Vader, really. Then deign to say who controls your clan?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_6">
		<text>A few months ago, the sect was taken under mental control by new special mutants - psionics. Unlike simple controllers, psionics didn't fry our brains and turn us into zombies, but rather turned us into working dogs of their masters.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_7">
		<text>And they gave you special medication? And what are the Hosts?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_8">
		<text>The same as the Monolith. "O-Consciousness. We remained human, and got rid of the need for cannibalism, but became obedient slaves to the O-Consciousness, even more loyal than the Monolith. We have increased in number, we have received from the masters new weapons, equipment and orders - to take control of the entire northern zone: from Pripyat to Zaton. That is, to do what the Monolith failed. First we began to infiltrate our people to the stalkers and factions on "Skadovsk" and Yanova. You yourself know that I was personally involved in this, first appearing on Zaton under the name Soroka, then on Yanovo under the name Flint.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_9">
		<text>Why weren't you killed by the freedom fighters after Loki found out about what you did on Skadovsk?</text>
    </string>	
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_10">
		<text>Anyways, I didn't really have time to do anything. Gaunt, scum, there broke my plans, then that stalker in the quarry - it was necessary to finish bitch. In short, I screwed up on my own. Anubis was already at work in Freedom, and he helped me avoid execution. After that, I only managed the actions of the other saboteurs - Warg, Myron, and Beetle. But Anubis played everything out.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_11">
		<text>What do you know about him?</text>
    </string>	
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_12">
		<text>Anubis was once a military saboteur, he began working in the Zone as soon as it appeared. However, when he was assigned to find out who was behind the second catastrophe, he either slipped up or got carried away. In general, his own people let him go to waste. But he survived and decided to exact his revenge. He was brought into the clan, but did not remain in it long. After learning what he should have known during his mission he went straight to Chernobyl. Nothing was heard from him for a year afterwards. Everyone thought he was dead, but he wasn't. He managed to reach the centre and meet the Hosts there. And he was accepted. He became their hand executioner - the first test subject of perhaps the most terrible O-Consciousness experiment since the creation of the Zone - the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. project. A project to produce the perfect human with hidden abilities and talents. Participants in this project were to help the "O-Consciousness" to establish full control over the Zone in order to further expand it.</text>.
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_13">
		<text>And the same subjects were Shooter and Scar?</text>.
    </string>
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_14">
		<text>Yes. But Anubis was the first among them. The first to have the mark on his hand. And the strongest.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_15">
		<text>What happened next</text>.
    </string>
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_16">
		<text>He returned to the South Zone in 2011 and took an active part in the events of that year. Strelk's first trek to the Chernobyl, plus the Clan War. "O-Consciousness learned that some stalker was seeking to infiltrate the restricted area in the heart of the Zone and decided to let him through. They needed new people for their project, but not just anyone, and only those who manage to get through the barrier alive and come close to the station itself. A kind of natural selection among those who wish to comprehend the unknown.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_17">
		<text>But it was a single ticket.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_18">
		<text>Right. Whoever made it would become another O-Consciousness test subject, the rest - who stumbled beyond the Barrier - would either die or join the Monolith faction. However, you know who managed to make it. Anubis, on the other hand, was in the Zone at the time, keeping an eye on what was going on. He reported to O-Consciousness on particularly zealous stalkers who might approach them. So in his field of vision got first Shooter, then Scar and some purebreds following their footsteps. Anubis did his best to make their path to the station more difficult, to weed out the weak and unworthy. The pitting of the Blues against the Freemen in the Dark Valley was, of course, his doing. He also helped the Renegades infiltrate and fortify the previously closed sector of Limansk, previously preventing the mercenaries, whom he had trapped in the Mobius Ring, from doing so. Before that, he'd used a powerful psi-stroke to kill the combined Freedom and Dolga units in control of the city.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_19">
		<text>And then what does he want now, and why exactly did you decide to tell me that?</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_20">
		<text>Mayor, I'm already dead. I'm sick of this life. I don't know why, but I managed to escape the psi control of the Masters and didn't become their slave like other sinners. But I didn't show it, trying to understand why the O-Consciousness needed us.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_21">
		<text>And did you manage to reveal their plans?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_22">
		<text>Particularly. Regarding the Sin clan, it's simple: the O-Consciousness didn't want to waste the forces of the Monolith, which had already suffered heavy losses after the storming of Chernobyl. We would have done our job - taken the north of the Zone under our control, besides the Hosts would have tested the new psy-control technology on us. After that our sect would cease to exist: leaders like me and the Demonologue and Hades would be killed, and simple sinners would join the ranks of the Monoliths. At least that's what Anubis said in his communication with the Masters.</text>
    </string>	
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_23">
		<text>But then I showed up and ruined your plans. Do you know anything else? Like about the Alpha Squad that links the CIA to the Masters of the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_24">
		<text>Not much. "Alpha was only indirectly helping us. And they didn't even know about the existence of O-Consciousness. It's just, you know - West can't stay away and everywhere, bitch, puts its nose where the Chernobyl dog didn't stick its dick...</text>.
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_25">
		<text>I see, but so Anubis - what exactly does he want? And where can he be found?</text>.
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_26">
		<text>This creature is like a seasoned chess player playing his game, rearranging the pieces as he sees fit. He wants to control all O-Consciousness activity in the Zone. And it benefited him that you were so eager to fight us. He seems to have personal interests unknown to the Hosts. He's a cunning beast, but I think he'll get what's coming to him.</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_27">
		<text>Do you think he can act without them telling him to?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_28">
		<text>Are you not?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_29">
		<text>Well, in general I think Anubis is capable of a lot, but not everything. Although, on the other hand, Shooter also seemed to say that he destroyed the O-Consciousness.</text>
    </string>.
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_30">
		<text>Mayor, you still don't get it to the end. The Rifleman, as well as Scar, was used by the O-Consciousness in their project, though they were given a different role than Anubis. The gunman did indeed cleanse the ranks of the O-Consciousness during his second campaign, but he did not destroy all of them. It seems that there is no unity in the organisation. But that's your headache. I have told you all I know...</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_31">
		<text>And now, after all this, you think that...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_32">
		<text>I'm not thinking anything anymore, I've already made my decision. I forgot, if you're in Pripyat, find my hiding place. It's in one of the basements. My notes are there, you'll learn more about Anubis. Now get out of the way. I've got C-4 with me. It'll explode in a few minutes. I didn't do it for nothing by telling you all this and keeping you alive after all. Stop Anubis, otherwise something terrible might happen...</text>
    </string>.
	<string id="jup_all_quest_greh_osiris_talking_33">

		<text>As you know, O-Consciousness was originally one of the secret projects that began operating in the Zone immediately after the first disaster in 1986. Its original purpose was to make people aware of what they did not yet understand. It touched on various aspects concerning the knowledge of new physical and other principles of the universe. A whole network of different laboratories, working on a single project, was set up in the Zone with money from the secret service. But their main task was to check the hypothesis of noosphere existence, the informational shell of the Earth. The experiments they conducted yielded stunning results, confirming a two-way connection between the noosphere and all living organisms on the planet through a so-called psi-field. With its help, they planned to improve the world by influencing people. The O-Consciousness staff decided to connect to the noosphere directly by combining their minds into one in a special complex near the Chernobyl nuclear power station. However, on April 12, 2006, at 14:33, the experiment went out of control and the anomalous energy of the noosphere rushed to the planet's surface and changed the physical laws in the Exclusion Zone, which is now called the "Zone".</text>

		<text>The disaster that occurred changed the minds of the scientists involved in the project themselves. "The O-Consciousness gained infinite power over this small territory. After that, the Monolith itself and the sect of the same name already appeared, which began to protect scientists. But over time, the scientists' opinions on the course of things in the Zone began to differ. Among the scientists there were two undisputed leaders - Professor Krechet and Professor Severov. Krechet became an odious tyrant who dreams of unlimited power. During one of the O-Consciousness sessions, Krechet managed to subjugate the minds of the other scientists. They were no longer human, their minds could no longer control their human shell - they became eternal prisoners of the information field to which they were connected. All except Professor Severov. He managed to survive, though he looked no longer human, but barely moving handicapped. And he realized that it was necessary to stop Krechet before he carried out his plan.</text>

		<text>And then what did they do?</text>.
    </string>
	<string id="all_quest_final_strelok_talking_14">
		<text>Krechet realized that Severov could not be subdued. He could not simply take him and kill him. Then the integrity of the collective mind of the O-Consciousness would be compromised, and similarly Severov could not kill Krechet. There was a stalemate, and then Krechet decided to launch a project "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", the basic concepts of which were developed even before the second disaster. According to this project, a series of experiments were conducted on the test subjects, which endowed them with superpowers. The first subject was Anubis. Admittedly, he was Krechet's most successful invention. You know he had the psychic ability of mutants but was still human. Then, in 2011, it was Scar and I, and Lebedev and Kalancha, who fell into the hands of O-Consciousness. That is when Severov entered the game. He changed some of the parameters in the experiment on me and Scar. So he programmed me to kill myself, in this case he suggested that in my search for myself I will go to Chernobyl and meet with the "Oh-Consciousness". And maybe I would be able to destroy it. Severov had it all figured out. He knew that if I killed even a single corporeal shell in the flask, I would destroy Krechet and his plans. But what Severov didn't count on was one thing. He knew that Scar and I had been treated as well as Anubis. But he had no idea what Krechet had done to Lebedev and Kalancha. Krechet managed to divide the integrity of the O-Consciousness project. He managed to create redundant sources of connection to the information field.</text>

He and Krechet knew that you would be their trump card in their continuing power struggle. That is why Anubis could not kill you sooner, he deliberately tried to convince you to leave the Zone, the creature-knew that you would not listen to him. They watched your progress, the way you dealt with the sectarians. Gyrfalcon really wanted to get his hands on you, but he didn't succeed. At least not yet. We can't let that happen. Major, report to your superiors that you've completed your task, Anubis is dead, the Sin clan has been destroyed. And after that, leave the Zone - we can't take any chances.

		<text>No, there's one more thing to do. As a prospector I also need to keep an eye on the availability of EO ammunition and other equipment on the ship.
