	<text>The VLC media player has returned to Apple's mobile devices after a more than two-year absence, reports The Next Web. The software is due to appear in the App Store on Friday, July 19.
The player is distributed free of charge and can play many video and audio formats. Among its features are support for network streaming and AirPlay, subtitle display and integration with cloud file storage Dropbox.
The app is compatible with iPhone smartphones, iPod touch players and iPad tablets running iOS 5.1 and later.
The first version of VLC was released on iOS in the fall of 2010, but in January 2011, the player was removed from the App Store by agreement between Apple and the development team of the project.
The reason for removing VLC from the shop was a licensing dispute: the rules of the App Store clashed with the terms of the GNU GPL "free" license, under which the player was distributed.
Now VLC developers have resolved the discrepancy by publishing the code under both the GNU GPL Version 2 and the Mozilla Public License Version 2. The latter allows the player to be distributed via the App Store.
The VLC player is available on Windows, OS X, Linux and other platforms. In the summer of 2012, the player was released on Android, but it still has the status of a beta version...</text>

	<text>Synthetic bacteria.</text>
</string>
<string id="ars_mar_b4_documents_2">
	<text>Scientists have found that some species of parasitic ichneumon flies are unable to produce fertile offspring simply because their intestines contain different symbiotic bacteria. This, the biologists say, suggests that symbionts can affect the formation of new species in the same way that geographical isolation does. The study is published in the journal Science and a summary is cited by ScienceNow.
The scientists' findings are based on work with three species of parasitic ichneumon flies that lay their eggs in fly larvae. Two of the three species, Nasonia giraulti and Nasonia longicornis, are evolutionarily quite close and can freely form fecund hybrids. The third species, Nasonia vitripennis, separated from the others about a million years ago and crossing with it from any of the first two species produces offspring that quickly die.
Having found that the two closely related species, unlike the third, possess almost identical microflora, scientists decided to test its effect on crossbreeding. To do this, the moths were reared on sterile feed with antibiotics and then crossed with each other. It turned out that almost all hybrids devoid of bacteria with a 'distant' species (Nasonia vitripennis) then begin to survive. If microbiologically sterile insects are infected with bacteria, their offspring become unviable again.
Scientists do not yet know what specific mechanisms are responsible for the death of the interspecific hybrids. Presumably, these insects have altered immune systems that are not suited to control 'alien' symbiotic bacteria
The work of biologists has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of speciation. Among the known 'classical' mechanisms of species separation are geographical and ecological isolation. It has also been experimentally shown recently that sexual selection alone is sometimes sufficient to maintain species separation...</text>

The road sign had an image of a drone, in addition to a notice inscription. Next to the drone, an object remotely resembling a rocket was drawn.
The local traffic police described the signs as fake and said they had been installed illegally. The police assured that they have no drones on their books, much less with weapons on board, and speed measurement is done by other methods.
At the same time, the traffic police noted the high quality of the fakes. The signs were made in compliance with all the requirements, they had a retroreflective coating and one of the signs was installed with vandal-proof fasteners.
The signs have been removed; police are now trying to find out who put them on the road. It is not reported how many signs were put up by the pranksters in total.
Note that the California Highway Patrol uses planes with pilots on board to monitor the traffic situation. Drivers are warned about it by appropriate signs. In a number of countries drones are also used to monitor the road - such an experiment, in particular, was launched in Russia, in the Krasnoyarsk region...</text>

	<text>Google has released a new version of its Maps app for iOS, according to its official blog. The program now supports not only iPhone and iPod touch, but also iPad tablets.
Other innovations in the application are the function "Search nearby", which displays places of interest to the user in the neighborhood, navigation within buildings (there are schemes of shopping malls, train stations and airports) and the ability to reroute the route when the road changes.
Some of the innovations, such as the road incident reporting service, integration with the Zagat restaurant guide and the display of special offers from shops and cafes, only work in the USAh.
You can save the map to a cache. It allows you to check with Google Maps without access to the Internet. In order to save a map you have to open the required fragment on the screen and type the phrase "ok maps" in the search line. However, the function is not available in Russia.
Google Maps in the first versions of Apple mobile "operating system" were used in the system as staff maps, but in iOS 6 Tim Cook has abandoned them in favor of their own maps.
After that Google had to distribute the program only through the App Store. The version of Google Maps available on the App Store until now was not designed for large tablet screens.
Simultaneously with the maps update for iOS, Google has made the new interface of the web version of Maps available to all users. The interface was shown in May at the I/O conference, and until July 16, only those with an invite could work with it...</text>

	<text>Cancer cells.</text>
</string>
<string id="ars_mar_b5_documents_2">
	<text>Scientists from Hungary and the UK have created an electric scalpel that can analyse the nature of the tissue being cut. Real-time mass spectrometry allows the doctor to determine where cancer cells end and healthy tissue begins. This makes it possible to remove tumours more accurately. Science Now provides details, citing a paper by the scientists in Science Translational Medicine.
The researchers first collected 3,000 samples of healthy and malignant tumour-affected tissues. They were then touched one after the other with an electric scalpel and a sample of the resulting gas (fumes) was taken. The gas mixture was analysed by a mass spectrometer and the results of the chemical analysis were compared with the histological examination of the same sample.
This comparison made it possible to identify the unique chemical markers of different tumours and to determine them by the composition of aerosols emitted when cutting with an electroscalpel. The surgical tool was supplemented with a tube that sucks the gas mixture to the mass spectrometer and thus enables analysis without any additional action by doctors during surgery. The development has been tested in the clinic during operations on 81 patients, but the long-term effects are not yet known. It will be possible to draw conclusions about whether the new method prevents tumour metastasis several years after the operation.
Histological examination of tissue is currently the main and most reliable way of identifying cancerous tumours: The cells are examined under the microscope by an expert histologist. But in operations, surgeons have to wait at least half an hour to find out the nature of the removed specimen. This leads to prolonged anaesthesia and does not ensure high precision, which is especially important in brain surgery.</text>

<string id="ars_mar_b5_documents_3">
	<text>Israeli engineers have developed flat and flexible sensors based on carbon nanoparticles. The development should help create prostheses capable of transmitting sensations not only of touch, but also of temperature and humidity to the wearer. The work of experts from the Technion-Israel Institute tells Science Daily, citing a publication of the researchers in the journal Applied Materials & Interfaces.
The new device is capable of detecting mechanical stress of a few hundredths of a gram, temperature changes within a degree, and differences in relative humidity of up to one percent. The new development still lags behind human skin in terms of mechanical sensitivity, but it is already sufficient for many practical applications.
The sensors are made of thin layers of gold nanoparticles bonded together, only 5 to 8 nanometres in diameter. Preliminary tests have shown that they remain functional when bent repeatedly together with a rubber substrate, and they can also be placed on different materials. In addition to prostheses, the new sensors can be used to monitor deformations in building structures and mechanical components: cracks will be detected with the same success as bending or twisting of a part.
The principle behind the sensors is that increasing humidity or temperature increases the conductivity of a ribbon of nanoparticles and the polymer substrate that binds them together, while bending causes the distance between the nanoparticles to decrease with a change in electrical resistance. Previously, scientists could make flat and flexible pressure sensors, but they could not register temperature and humidity...</text>

<string id="ars_mar_b6_documents_1">
	<text>The Russian Ministry of Defence will soon acquire new Russian-made mobile hospitals based on the Tsentrospas unit of the Emergencies Ministry's aero-mobile hospitals. As reported by the newspaper Izvestiya with reference to a source in the Main Military Medical Directorate, requirements to the equipment of new hospitals are currently being worked out taking into account scenarios of their application in combat conditions.
In total, it is planned to buy four mobile hospitals; one for each military district. Earlier, military medics had planned to buy hospitals from the German company Zeppelin. Now it was decided to buy only Russian-made hospitals. In the version for the military, special attention will be paid to equipping them with surgical instruments and equipment, as well as consumables.
At present special medical units of the Russian armed forces use mobile medical complexes on the basis of KAMAZ trucks. The capacity of these vehicles is up to 250 people; the complexes are equipped with a full range of medical equipment and are as good as stationary military hospitals in their capabilities. However, the deployment time of KamAZ-mounted ambulance units is too long.
The airmobile hospital of the Russian EMERCOM includes intensive care, surgical, consultative and diagnostic and X-ray units, ultrasonic diagnostics and electrocardiography units, as well as a blood laboratory. The hospital can accommodate up to a hundred patients a day and can operate autonomously for a fortnight. The complex can be airlifted anywhere and deployed at short notice.</text>

	<text>The International Football Federation (FIFA) has announced ticket prices for matches at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, the Associated Press reports.
The cheapest ticket for foreign spectators will cost $90. It will allow fans coming to Brazil from abroad to attend one of the group stage matches of the competition. Foreigners will have to pay between $440 and $990 for a seat in the grandstand during the final match.
For Brazilians, the cheapest ticket to a home World Cup match will cost $15. That's the cost for Brazilian students, residents over the age of 60, and participants in some social programs to attend a group stage match. The minimum ticket price for the rest of the country starts at $30.
At the previous World Cup, held in 2010 in South Africa, the minimum ticket price for locals was $20. Earlier, Brazilian authorities promised that tickets for the 2014 World Cup for residents of the country will be the cheapest in the history of the competition. However, AP notes, most Brazilians, where the official minimum wage is about $340, will not be able to afford even discounted tickets.
The first phase of ticket sales for the 2014 FIFA World Cup will take place on the FIFA website from August 20 to October 10. The most popular ticket holders for the matches will be chosen by randomly selecting the entries left. The second stage of ticket sales will begin on December 8, after the group stage match schedule is announced.
A total of around three million tickets are expected to be sold by the tournament organisers. At least 400,000 of these are reserved for Brazilians, including around 50,000 tickets for those working on the stadiums and other World Cup infrastructure. The exact number of tickets on sale will be determined after all the 12 stadiums hosting the 2014 World Cup are completed, said FIFA.
According to the preliminary estimates, the cost of the Brazilian budget for the preparation and holding of the FIFA World Cup in 2014 will be around 14 billion euros. World Cup costs were one of the reasons behind the mass protests in Brazil at the end of May and beginning of June 2013...</text>

<string id="ars_mar_b7_documents_3">
	<text>Sven Co-op modification to Half-Life will become a separate game. This was announced by the developers on the official forum of the project.
According to representatives of the team working on the mod, this was made possible thanks to cooperation with the Valve studio, which released Half-Life. The company provided the creators of the mod access to the GoldSrc engine, on the basis of which the developers will make a standalone version of their modification.
After its completion, the game will be released on Steam, where it will be available to all its users for free. It will include the whole Half-Life 1 campaign, and to play in Sven Co-op, you won't have to buy this shooter separately. In the future, the developers also promised, that they will continue to support the project and make regular updates. However, they also did not reveal the exact release date of the standalone Sven Co-op version.
Work on Sven Co-op has been underway for the past 15 years. The first version of the mod was released in 1999. Thus, it is considered the oldest mod for Half-Life, which is still in development. However, as noted by the creators of the mod, they are currently preparing to release its final version, after which they will start creating a separate game.
It is worth to mention, that earlier gamers released another Half-Life fan project. In September, 2012 the game Black Mesa was released, that is the much improved version of this shooter. Black Mesa is based on Source engine. It is worth to mention, however, that this game includes only a part of the game. The adventures of Gordon Freeman in the world of Zen are not included into Black Mesa, and the developers of shooter plan to release them later.
The first part of Half-Life went on sale in 1998. Six years later Valve released the sequel and then introduced two sequels, which took place in the same world as HL - Portal and Portal 2. The third instalment of Gordon Freeman's story is considered one of the most anticipated games in the world. Rumours of its imminent announcement regularly appear on the web, but they have never been officially confirmed...</text>

At a meeting with investors, the head of the company Yves Guillemot also clarified the release date of the racing game The Crew. According to him, it should go on sale by April 1, 2014. On top of that, Ubisoft has also announced the postponement of its as yet unannounced franchise. It will now not go on sale until the next fiscal year (i.e. between April 2014 and the end of March 2015). No details about the project were provided by the company's head.
The Division multiplayer game was unveiled at E3-2013. It is due to be released on next-gen consoles Xbox One and PS4. The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, known for Far Cry 3 and Assassin's Creed Revelations.
The Division is set in an alternate version of our world, where one day on Black Friday an extremely dangerous virus begins to spread around the world. In just five days, it leads to a global catastrophe. The events of the game unfold shortly after the epidemic. The protagonists are the members of special department, whose goal is to save the surviving population.
After it became known, that Ubisoft is going to release the game only on the consoles, the gamers asked the publisher to make the PC version as well. They even started to collect signatures on a petition (and gathered more than 131 thousand). However, the publisher has not yet given a clear answer on whether the game will be released on this platform.</text>

Gorshenev was born on August 7, 1973 in Boksitogorsk, Leningrad Region. He started playing music when he was still in school. In 1988, together with his classmates Alexander Balunov and Alexander Shigolev, he formed the band Kontora. In 1990 they were joined by Andrey Knyazev. In the same year they named their band King of Jesters, which later got its present name.
The first studio album "By a Stone on the Head" was released by the musicians in 1996. All in all, the band has recorded 12 studio albums throughout its history.
Gorshenev was also one of the creators of the idea for the musical TODD, dedicated to the barber Sweeney Todd. The musician played the main role in the production. In 2011 and 2012 he released two albums based on material from the musical King and Jester.
The musician has been married twice. His second wife's name is Olga. In 2009 she gave birth to Gorshenev's daughter.
In an interview with the authors of the book "And the Living Sing about the Dead", dedicated to the band King and Jester, Gorshenev admitted to using heroin in the 1990s. The overdose left him clinically dead eight times, he said. The book was published in 2007.</text>

<string id="ars_mar_b8_documents_3">
	<text>London's Globe Theatre will go on tour for two years in 2014 to celebrate the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth. The Globe's website reports that the theatre will tour the world with a production of Hamlet.
This will be the first major tour in the theatre's history. As part of the marathon tour, the Globe troupe will visit every country in the world and perform in theatres, beaches, jungles and castles. The theatre's aim is to perform in 205 countries. The last point of the tour will be the Danish city of Elsinore, where the action of Hamlet unfolds.
Artistic Director of the theatre, Dominique Dromgoole, explained his choice by the fact that "Hamlet" is a Shakespeare play that is known everywhere. Theatre director Peter Brook concurred with the theatre's choice, adding that the simplest words in the English language are "to be or not to be" from "Hamlet" and that there is hardly a single place in the world where they have not been translated.
The theatre marathon will begin on 23 April 2014 at the Globe Theatre and end there exactly two years later in 2016. This will also be Dromgoole's last day as artistic director of the theatre.
The Globe Theatre was built in London in 1599 by the Servants of the Lord Chamberlain, a troupe to which Shakespeare belonged. In 1613 the theatre burned down, then it was rebuilt, and existed in this form until 1642. The modern Globe was built in 1997 close to the original site. "The Globe regularly undertakes large-scale projects, trying to unite people of different cultures and nationalities through the work of the great English playwright. In spring 2012, for instance, in the run up to the London Olympics, the Globe hosted a festival of 37 theatre companies which performed plays by Shakespeare in 37 languages...</text>

	<text>A monument to Dagestani poet Rasul Gamzatov was unveiled in the centre of Moscow. As reported by RIA Novosti, the opening ceremony of the monument was held on Yauza Boulevard. It was dedicated to the 90th anniversary of the poet's birth.
President Vladimir Putin, acting Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin, acting Senator of the Federation Council from Dagestan Ilyas Ukhmanov and acting President of the Republic Ramazan Abdulatipov attended the ceremony. In addition, relatives and friends of Gamzatov attended the unveiling of the monument.
The authors of the monument were several sculptors, including Alexei Tikhonov, Igor Novikov and Shamil Kanaygadzhiev. The monument was erected with funds donated by the Rasul Gamzatov Foundation, and presented to Moscow.
Poet Rasul Gamzatov was born in 1923. He published his first collection of poems written in the Avar language at the age of 20. In 1952, he was awarded the Stalin Prize, and 11 years later the Lenin Prize. His best-known collections of poems and verses include In the Mountains, My Heart and The High Stars.
Rasul Gamzatov died in 2003. He is buried in the village of Tarki, a suburb of Makhachkala.</text>

<string id="ars_mar_b9_documents_3">
	<text>Police have searched flats, offices and prison cells in northern Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland in the case of the international neo-Nazi terrorist group Werewolf. This was reported by Bloomberg agency, citing a statement from the German prosecutor's office.
About 50 police officers were involved in the searches in Germany alone. Swiss authorities searched the cells of two prisoners who were allegedly involved in the organisation.
Six people are suspected in the case so far and none of them have been detained, Spiegel said. Their nationalities have not been specified. Law enforcement authorities say they have failed to disclose the plans of the attacks, which, according to them, were hatched by the members of the group. German police are hoping that the searches will help investigators learn more about the suspects' intentions.
So far all that is known is that members of the group wanted to change the system of government in Germany. They developed a special encryption program to communicate with each other, the Associated Press noted.
The name "Werewolf" (which means werewolf in German) was a Nazi militia created in 1944, when World War II was about to end. This German unit was to carry out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines.
German authorities began to pay particular attention to neo-Nazi movements after the NSU (National Socialist Underground) group was exposed in 2011. Its members are accused of involvement in the murders of nine immigrants from Turkey and Greece as well as a local policewoman. They are also charged with two bombings and numerous bank robberies. The NSU trial began in May 2013...</text>

	<text>IP-4 (IP-4M, IP-4 MK, IP-4 MP) isolation gas masks, unlike filter gas masks, completely isolate the respiratory organs from the environment. Breathing in IP-4 gas mask is achieved by continuous supply of oxygen in the mask. IP-4, IP-4M, IP-4 MK, IP-4 MP self-contained gas masks are used when filter gas masks cannot be used, particularly in cases of oxygen deficiency in the environment, very high concentrations of chemical agents, and other hazardous substances, when working under water.
The IP-4 insulating gas mask is used for protection of respiratory organs, eyes, face and head during gas rescue and recovery operations. The gas masks allow the user to work even in areas where there is a total lack of oxygen: in accidents, natural disasters, sabotage. IP-4 MK insulating gas mask is used in an unbreathable atmosphere, including those containing chlorine (up to 10%), ammonia, hydrogen sulphide. IP-4MR insulating gas mask is a routine gas mask. The isolating gas mask can be worn together with the protective suit.
The principle of operation of an insulating gas mask is based on the extraction of oxygen from chemicals by absorbing carbon dioxide and moisture exhaled by the wearer. Isolation gas masks comprise a face piece, a regenerative cartridge, a breathing bag and a bag. In addition, the IP-4 self-contained gas mask is supplied with waterproofing membranes and, at the customer's request, with insulating cuffs. The face piece of the full face mask protects breathing organs from surroundings, directs exhaled air into the sensor and delivers the carbon dioxide-enriched gas mixture to the breathing organs as well as protects the eyes and face.
The IP-4M, IP-4MK and IP-4MR gas masks have the MIA-1 mask as their face piece. It is fitted with an intercom system and an under-mask. The RP-4 regenerative cartridge for IP-4 IP-4M, IP-4 MK and IP-4 MR self-contained gas masks ensures the generation of oxygen for breathing, the absorption of carbon dioxide and moisture from the exhaled air.
The bag is designed to store and carry the masks. Since the face part of the isolating gas mask has insufficient thermal protection properties, it is recommended to work in it with the hood of a protective suit on the head.
The oxygen supply in the RP-4 allows one to work in an SPRA during heavy physical exertion for 45 minutes, during medium loads - 70 minutes, and during light loads and in a state of relative rest - 3 hours.
It is allowed to work continuously for 8 hours in the EP-4 insulating gas mask with a change of RP-4.
Repeated use is allowed only after 12 hours rest.
Periodic use of a gas mask - 3-4 hours daily for 2 weeks.
Technical characteristics:
Gas mask weight - max. 4 kg.
Weight of regenerative cartridge - not more than 2.2 kg.
Overall dimensions of the gas mask - 340õ163õ290 mm.
Overall dimensions of the regenerative cartridge - 125x250 mm.
Working capacity of breathing bag - not less than 4.5 l.
Breathing bag duration - 60-160 s.
Resistance of the overpressure valve to a constant air flow of 1.5 dm3/min - not more than 392 Pa (40 mm water column).
The closing pressure of the overpressure valve is at least 98 Pa (10 mm water column). 
The breathing resistance of an insulating gas mask is 1176 Pa (120 mm w.g.) or less.
The amount of oxygen given off by the starter briquette during decomposition should be not less than 10 litres.
The temperature of the inhaled gas mixture during heavy physical work must not exceed 50 degrees Celsius.
The duration of the gas mask is determined by the physical load and is as follows
at heavy physical load (running, assembly of large parts, carrying heavy loads, debris removal) - 30-40 min.
medium physical activity (walking, maintenance of mechanisms, work with indicator devices) - 60-75 min.
under light physical activity (technical inspection of equipment, observation of instrument readings) - 180 min.

	<text>The PASGT-H helmet was introduced into service in the early eighties. The PASGT-H helmet is made from Kevlar 29 sandwich reinforced fabric and weighs only 1.4 to 1.9kg, unlike the old type of steel helmet. It is available in five sizes and provides protection to the head, forehead, temples, ears and upper neck from projectiles, grenade fragments, rocks and non-ballistic impacts (hitting surfaces, being hit by various objects such as rocks, sticks, beams etc.). The helmet is not intended to protect against small arms bullets. (From the author. Don't smirk ironically, dear reader. No helmet in the world will save your forehead from a machine gun or rifle bullet. Even a bullet from an AK-74 can easily pierce a steel helmet at a range of 800 metres. Even if the helmet can be made bullet-proof it will not make the soldier feel any better. After all force of blow even from a bullet from the Makarov pistol is equal to force of blow of 2 kg sledge hammer with a full swing. Will your spine be able to stand it?) The protective helmet in all cases is covered by a camouflage cap sewn from the same fabric as the uniform itself. If necessary, the helmet may be covered with pieces of camouflage netting (clearly visible in the photo) or improvised camouflage media (branches, grass, pieces of cloth, etc.) may be inserted under the elastic band.</text>

	<text>We are well aware of the main factors of modern combat:
- ballistic - 75-90 % (including fine splinters of shells, mines and grenades - up to 80 %);
- thermal (by influence of open flame and combustible mixtures) - 1,4-2,3 %;
- Dynamic (shock wave) - 4.2-4.9 %.
The overall incidence of limb injuries is 56-67%, with a fatality rate of 6-12%.
At the same time, in most armies of the world, personal body armor is traditionally limited to a helmet and a bullet-proof waistcoat; their combined area of protection does not exceed 30-35% of the body surface, leaving the extremities and face unprotected. For example, even the United States, which has become very experienced in local military conflicts around the world, only began equipping its forces with separate anti-shrapnel limb protection elements in 2011, after assessing the results of recent combat operations.
Against this background the Russian combat protective kit (CPC) Permyachka looks very promising, since it is the first in the world practice to provide comprehensive protection for a serviceman. This kit has no analogues neither in Russia, nor abroad, and possesses a wide range of service and operational characteristics. The total protection area of the suit is three times larger than that of armoured individual protection means existing in the world.
The suit provides all-round protection for personnel of combat units against low-speed fragments of shells, mines and grenades, protection against open flame, atmospheric exposure and mechanical damage, protection of vital organs from damage by high-speed fragmentation elements, bullets of rifles and automatic rifles.
The basic parameters of the kit are as follows:
- all-round protection against shrapnel impacts over an area of 180-220 sq.dm, including limbs, eyes and face, against shrapnel at the level of SS-68 steel helmet, as well as against the effects of open flame for at least 15 seconds;
- protection of at least 90% of vital organs area in frontal and dorsal projections against high velocity splinters and bladed weapons;
- protection against bullets from AK74, AKM, SVD, M16A1, M16A2 rifles and armour concussion trauma (together with bulletproof armour blocks);
- weakening of cutting effect of cold weapons in the area of forearms;
- impact protection in the areas of coccyx, femur, shoulder and elbow joints.
The Elements of life support ensure protection of a serviceman from adverse environmental conditions, transportation of elements of combat outfit, help to overcome water obstacles, provide camouflage in summer and winter conditions.
The product has been in service with the Russian Army since 2004.
The use of the BZK in combat conditions can significantly reduce personnel casualties and enhance the combat capabilities of units.
For example, the use of the combat protective kit in the course of counter-terrorist operations in the North Caucasus has already saved the lives and health of many members of the Russian army.
The result of further work on improving the protective and operational capabilities of the BZK Permyachka is the upgraded Permyachka-M combat protective kit, the composition of which has been expanded by a number of additional unique elements.

	<text>The Barmitsa Personal Protective Equipment Kit (PPEK) created in Russia has no analogues in the world. It is intended for personnel of motorized rifle units of the Ground Forces, Airborne Forces and special purpose units operating in combat conditions. The kit takes into account the requirements of maximum unification, combinability of outfit elements between each other and with combat equipment, and multi-functionality of their use. The barmitsa includes more than 60 standard and newly developed elements.
The basic set of the Barmica individual outfit contains both familiar, but higher-quality items of equipment and completely new items, and during its design the particular attention was paid to the optimum combination of the tactical and technical characteristics of all the components. Individual communication, reconnaissance, navigation and life support equipment, increased level of protection against enemy means and physiological and hygienic characteristics of combat clothing, as well as improved food and medical support, all of which together should result in a qualitative increase in the combat effectiveness of the troops.
The new 5.45 mm AN-94 Abakan submachine guns and 7.62 mm Pecheneg machine guns, most suitable for motorized rifle units, have been included in the SCIE. For each speciality of servicemen of the Army, Airborne Forces and SPF units, the type and purpose of individual and group carried weapons were determined. The use of new personal body armour (the Zabralo waistcoat, capable of withstanding a bullet fired from an AK-74 from a distance of 10 meters, and the Borit-M protective helmet), as calculations show, can reduce casualties by more than 20% (the number of deaths from all types of projectiles will be reduced by 60-70%). The specially designed portable radio station is designed to provide open or closed radio communication in the chain of command company commander - platoon commander - squad leader - soldier. It maintains contact with the radio stations of the Aqueduct complex as well as with the radio stations of the old Arbalet fleet. During the cold season, in temperatures as low as -30° C, the soldiers will be protected from frost by a new winter suit. Its details are unified as much as possible with each other, as well as with similar details in samples of special and summer field clothing. The feet are protected from low temperatures, dust, sand, mud and snow by special footwear, the bottom of which is resistant to aggressive environments. Various multifunctional equipment is used to support the troops. A cloak tent can serve as a stretcher in addition to its direct purpose, and several tents joined together can assemble a large volume tent. A raid rucksack to carry the BCIE elements including an insulating mat, retains its functionality even when dropped onto rocky ground from a height of ten metres. The combat overgarment and body armour waistcoats have a wide variety of pouch attachment points and pockets, depending on the type of weapon being carried and the quantity of ammunition. They can be quickly donned and doffed. The sleeping bag equipped with polyethylene mat, mosquito net and inflatable cushion allow to have a rest during 4 hours in minus 20°Ñ temperature, as well as to transport a serviceman weighing up to 120 kg. Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the respiratory and eye organs, as well as skin, protective gloves and stockings are available in case of use of weapons of mass destruction.
Within the framework of the development work, autonomous state tests are being carried out to test the compatibility of the standard paratroopers and those under development as part of the BKEE, and to improve their suspension system.
The special elements of the SCIE include survival equipment, water purification filter, night operation kit, individual source

	<text>Ratnik is a Russian soldier's combat outfit, also referred to as "the soldier of the future kit". "Ratnik" is part of an overall project to improve the quality of the individual soldier on the battlefield by using the latest scientific achievements in the field of navigation, night vision systems, monitoring of psychophysiological state of the soldier, the use of advanced materials in the manufacture of armor and clothing fabric The system is a set of modern protection, communication, weapons and ammunition. Research and development work was carried out by dozens of Russian defence enterprises such as FSUE. As conceived by the creators, the new outfit will be able to compete on an equal footing with similar outfits of "soldiers of the future". The Ratnik consists of about 10 subsystems.  According to Yuri Borisov, first deputy chairman of the Military-Industrial Commission of the Russian government, this kit will differ in its modular configuration and will be adapted for action in a variety of conditions and at any time of day. "Ratnik" was developed on the basis of the "Barmitsa" outfit.
The outfit was first presented to the audience at the MAKS air show Military trials were held in December 2012 at the 27th Independent Motorized Rifle Brigade in Alabino near Moscow. According to the results of the military tests, the outfit's components were positively assessed by the military command. The "Ratnik" consists of several dozens of items of equipment, including:
Aramid coveralls made of Alutex fibre that can withstand shrapnel from grenades, mines or shells and also have a certain fire resistance;
Protection set includes body armor 6Á43 (with ceramic plates) of protection class 6à in extended version (weight - up to 15 kg) or class 5 in standard version (weight - up to 9 kg) according to GOST R 51136-98, GOST R 51112-97, GOST R 50941-96. And multilayer helmet withstands pistol bullet impact (protection class 1) from 5-10 m distance. 
The set is equipped with a control system "Strelets", which includes communication means, target designation, processing and display of information, identification - which allows to transmit information about the whereabouts of the soldier to the command post;
communicator determining a soldier's coordinates by means of Glonass and GPS, for solving the problem of orientation and target designation, and other applied calculations
power packs;
protective goggles capable of withstanding hits from 6mm fragments travelling at 350m/s;
knee and elbow pads;
water purification filters, self-contained heat sources;
AK-12, or upgraded AK in other versions, equipped with night vision sight and thermal imaging sighting system;
video module for firing from cover, consisting of helmet-mounted mini-monitor and TV sight;
Krechet collimating sight and other equipment (the sight can be complemented by a 3X magnification telescope or Lun night vision monocular);
the life-support system includes backpacks of different types (50-liter multi-purpose backpack; 10-liter raid knapsack; an off-loading waistcoat with interchangeable quick-release parts); camouflage packs; foldable heat insulating pad; removable winter insulation; ventilated T-shirt; waistcoat with compartments for ammunition; mat; cap; hat; goggles; mosquito net;
tent, sleeping bag; 
active headphones to communicate during battle; 
knife "Bumblebee".
The total weight of the kit is up to 20 kg with Class 6A body armour. In the standard version the weight will be up to 14 kg with Class 5A body armour. Weight of helmet is 1.056 kg. In total it covers 90% of the soldier's body surface. The bulletproof vest has several varieties from light to heavy with insertable plates. The marine version of the bulletproof vest also has life jacket properties, which makes it possible to remain afloat with it. The modularity allows all kinds of pockets to be fitted on the waistcoat. The winter version will differ only in terms of heat supply and insulation. Designed to be worn continuously for at least 48 hours. The video information from the rifle scope is transmitted wirelessly to the eyepiece indicator. The communication system will enable the soldier to communicate with commanders and fellow soldiers on a tactical level. The electronics saturation makes the soldier a unified combat system, controlled by the latest technology. At the same time, information about the soldier's location is transmitted to the command post (CP), which greatly reduces the likelihood of a soldier going missing. Communication is provided by the Sagittarius reconnaissance, command and communications complex, which enables information exchange by voice or text messages, target designation, photo and video shooting. The telescope sight on the automatic rifle provides an image into the eyepiece, which enables firing and observation from cover or from the hip. For anti-aircraft gunners, an automatic air defence system has been developed which enables the commander to detect targets at a distance of several tens of kilometres and automatically transmit the coordinates to the soldiers. Up to nine anti-aircraft gunners can receive commands from a single point. This will eliminate the need for anti-aircraft gunners to visually search for targets themselves. The system allows for ambushing soldiers at the right moment for a shot and then hiding again. It can also be used by snipers and grenade launchers for target acquisition. It will be possible to use such a system for guarding military convoys. 
At the end of service, the shabby clothing will be handed over to new recruits after being decontaminated.

	<text>One of the first items to enter the French army under the Scorpion programme will be the so-called "soldier's kit of the future" - the "digital" soldier's kit FELIN is often referred to in this way. In our opinion, the experience, gained by the French armament specialists and military during the project, will be very useful for the domestic armament, military and special equipment producers. Especially the special weapons and equipment for the personnel of motorized rifle units.
 The main contractor for the FELIN kit is the French company Sagem Defense Securite. FELIN is an acronym for Fantassin a Equipement et Liaisons Integres, which means "Integrated Infantryman's Equipment and Communications" in French. This kit incorporates new and improved personal protective equipment, camouflaged jackets and trousers, along with traditional FAMAS assault rifle, wearable personal computer, radio, GPS receiver with extensive digital terrain maps, helmet-mounted information display, optical systems, including sighting equipment. The FELIN uses two lithium-ion batteries manufactured by the Swiss Leclanche industrial group as power sources for the numerous electronics.
 Work on the programme started in the first half of the 1990s, and between 1997 and 2000 prototypes of the equipment developed under the programme went through a phase of demonstration trials and initial selection by the military, as well as agreement on final tactical and technical requirements. Field trials of the kit's major elements took place in early 2000, with one group of soldiers fitted with FELIN, while the other group used the traditional equipment and weapons already in the French army. The members of the first group emerged victorious from all tests and organised training battles. Even though they were outfitted in "older" versions of the kit, which had significantly heavier mass and less integrated equipment than the current FELINs.
 Currently, three versions of the kit have been developed and are being prepared for field testing: for soldiers, for squad leaders, and for platoon leaders. In addition, all equipment and armaments included in the FELIN are divided into three groups according to their operation and purpose: individual purpose, special purpose and collective use.
The individual-purpose subsystems include six pieces of equipment:
protective clothing with the elements of moisture- and flame-protection and WMD protection, as well as the means of individual armor protection (the basis of this subsystem is a unloading waistcoat of a new modification to which individual armor protection means are mounted; the so-called "electronic waistcoat" is a system of optoelectronic and other radio equipment comprising a personal computer, communication means, "man-machine" interface, GPS receiver, etc.). The "wearable electronic platform" is a system of optoelectronic radio equipment comprising a personal computer, communications equipment, man-machine interface (HMI), GPS receiver, etc;
a "wearable electronic platform", which is the "heart" of the FELIN kit and includes, among other things, those optoelectronic and radio facilities that are part of the "electronic waistcoat" (the platform equipment is based on the USB 2.0 digital interface and has an open architecture, allowing new or additional pieces of radio electronic equipment to be included as required)
personal power supply equipment;
Personal weaponry - the FAMAS assault rifle is the main weapon of the soldier using the FELIN kit, but the 5.56 mm MINIMI light machine guns or 7.62 mm FRS2 sniper rifles with appropriate sights, including infra-red ones, can be used as required. The FAMAS rifle is equipped with a small-size video camera, which can transmit images to the observation and information-gathering systems of the squad leader and platoon leader;
The combat helmet has three components - a protective combat helmet with the capability of using protective face shields, a communication system, and an optoelectronic system. The combat helmet has an integrated protective mask which can be used in the event of enemy use of weapons of mass destruction and which enables the wearer to ingest water and food without removing the mask (the mask breathing system uses either an air cylinder or a regenerative filter cylinder, if required). The communication system is integrated into the helmet, but can also be used without it. The optoelectronic system comprises a helmet-mounted camera incorporating EBCMOS technology, an OLED-based information display (displays graphical, textual and visual information from a personal computer, a video camera and other information sources, including external), and a FELIN communications system that enables information exchange between servicemen and unit commanders (the radio station of any soldier can be connected to two communications systems simultaneously - squad level and platoon level). The radio communication system has features such as a soldier's panic button to signal the squad and platoon commander, and a channel for autonomous data transmission, while the platoon commander also has a module for communication with the higher command. The communications system is based on the proven and highly performing civilian DECT technology.
 Special purpose subsystems:
the soldier's terminal information system;
Universal infra-red binoculars (for platoon commander only);
The FELIN kit's storage and carrying case (using a standard plastic case type iM3220 from Hardigg Industries).
 Shared-use subsystems:
battery recharging system from the FELIN kits;
a family of armoured combat vehicles designed for use by units equipped with FELIN kits (AMX-10P, VBCI and VAB type armoured combat vehicles).
 The FELIN kit will be available in five variants. It will include weapons, ammunition, body armour, communication and data exchange equipment, laptop computer, helmet with two displays and microphone, GPS receiver, batteries, as well as a daily ration of food and water. The total weight of the individual equipment will not exceed 25 kilograms.
 Three types of weapons will be available, the Nexter F1 FAMAS assault rifle in 5.56 millimeter caliber, the Nexter (formerly Giat) sniper rifle FR-F2 in 7.62 millimeter and the Minimi light machine gun in 5.56 millimeter, FN Herstal.
 All weapons will be equipped with new day and night sights, as well as improved target designation equipment. Video sights will enable firing from cover, while keeping the enemy out of sight and out of harm's way. The infantrymen will be provided with Sagem's Clara electro-optical image intensifier sights, while unit commanders will be provided with infrared sights. All will be able to transmit real-time images within the FELIN networks.
 The equipment will also include Sagem's JIM MR multifunction binoculars. They feature an uncooled thermal imaging channel, an eye-safe laser rangefinder, and a digital magnetic compass. Thales' new PR4G VS4 tactical radios will enable infantrymen to exchange voice and visual information both within units and with higher-level networks.
 The FELIN series is designed to allow soldiers to know the exact location of their comrades at all times, and with a dedicated man-machine interface, can fire their individual weapons at targets they can't see, such as a corner or cover, while keeping their heads down. Also, conventional headphones were replaced with headphones and microphones with vibration capabilities. Such headphones, for example, are attached to the person slightly below the ear, and the soldier receives information from vibrations affecting the zygomatic bone and then transmitted to the person's inner ear.
As can be seen, the French set has much in common with a similar set designed for the US Army ("Land Warrior"), which is already being tested in combat in Iraq. Though there are some differences: for example, US kit enables any soldier in the unit to get all tactical information, including digital maps indicating positions of friendly and enemy forces, while in FELIN only platoon commanders (squad leaders and ordinary soldiers do not get them) have a right of access to tactical maps.
 The initial contract for FELIN was awarded to the prime contractor in March 2004 - under its terms, the company has to supply 31,455 of these kits to various branches of the French Army: infantry - 22,588, armored units - 2,801, engineering units - 3,576, artillery - 2,480.
 The FELIN is due to enter service in 2009, with the first 350 being delivered to customer by end 2008, to equip the first French Army unit, a French infantry battalion, which will conduct extensive trials. If the tests are successful, the contractor will be required to deliver 5,045 FELIN kits to five infantry regiments between mid-2009 and the end of 2010.
 Although a number of experts have already voiced concerns that there could be a delay, mainly for technical and technological reasons, related primarily to the need to ensure full integration of all subsystems of the kit with the corresponding ground force systems. For example, one FELIN advisor told French specialized media that "there are a number of serious problems with ensuring the normal functioning of the helmet-mounted information display and its integration with a number of other systems. According to him, the development company won't have time to fix the "shortcomings" by the end of 2008, forcing it to push back the deadline for deliveries to the French ground forces.
 However, the French are not alone in their woes: the digital soldier programme in the US Army was also going through a difficult time. The American developers were able to get rid of all the technical and technological problems only after two years of painstaking work and numerous military tests.

	<text>The IdZ (German: Infanterist der Zukunft) is a German set of individual equipment for soldiers, the so-called "soldier's kit of the future". The current version of this program is called IdZ-ES (Expanded System).
The IdZ programme was launched in 1996 almost immediately after the creation of a similar programme in the USAh. The first prototypes were tested during the war in Yugoslavia, but they showed low efficiency and funding for the program was cut. Development continued after the deployment of Bundeswehr units as part of the coalition forces in Afghanistan in 2002. In 2006, the Bundeswehr awarded a $34.4 million contract to Rheinmetall Defence Electronics to develop a prototype second-generation IdZ-ES kit and deliver the first 20 units by May 2007 for further testing in Afghanistan.

	<text>The Pentagon has been thinking about a computerised and technically equipped soldier since the 1980s. But the agency had to give up on the Land Warrior project because the corresponding equipment weighed almost 40kg and the batteries powering the soldier only lasted four hours. And now, Future Force Warrior has become the son of, above all, nanotechnology. It has an assault rifle capable of firing not only rounds, but also a 15 mm mini-missile, equipped with a thermal guidance system so that it never misses its target. The new specimen can also produce electrical discharges to incapacitate the enemy. The soldier is equipped with goggles. They are used as binoculars for long-range views, up to several kilometres. If something has to be seen up close, the goggles act as the Mantis system, copied from insects, which allows combining visual, infrared and thermal images into a single image, thus answering the main question: What is behind this door? Naturally, the soldier can lower a mini-monitor to his eye, which allows him to view the object from different angles. And if the Mantis system isn't enough to avert the threat, electronic sensors that signal explosives or the presence of a person, and super-microphones capable of hearing conversations from 50 metres away come into play. 
As for the enemy, there is equipment on the soldier that informs about the temperature, heart rate, location of the soldier himself. In addition, there is a reinforcement made of nanomaterials that, like the air bag on a car, activates when a soldier is struck: it becomes rigid, like steel, from which bullets bounce. The same nanomaterials can become nano-materials, increasing a soldier's strength by 25-30 per cent.

	<text>The Russian Ministry of Defense is currently developing the "Fighter-21" combat outfit for the Ground Forces, Airborne Forces and Marines with the estimated completion date of 2015 
The Russian Defense Ministry is currently developing the "Fighter-21" combat outfit for the Army, Airborne Forces and Marines, with work planned to be completed by 2015, a representative of the 3rd Central Research Institute (TsNII) of the Russian Defense Ministry, Associate Professor Vladimir Boyko, said on Tuesday. "The 'second generation' kit will include defeat, protection, control, life support and power supply systems," Boyko said at a conference at the Interpolitech-2009 international security systems exhibition in Moscow. According to Boyko, the combat outfit set to be created will have no analogues in the world in terms of its efficiency. At the same time existing combat outfit of "first generation" already surpasses western samples in some parameters, in particular in degree of protection. 
According to the expert, the new kit will be 14 kilograms lighter than the previous one, its total weight will drop from the current 36 kilograms to 22, RIA Novosti reports. "The development of armor material using nanotechnology is underway, new materials will appear in the next few years," Boyko said. "The kit will incorporate elements of exoskeleton structures (a metal skeleton that removes unnecessary strain from human muscles)," he added
The approximate cost of R&D (research and development) for the Boyz-21 is estimated at around $35 million, according to the developers. At the same time, the United States, for example, allocates $1.5 billion for similar work, the rapporteur said. "The allocations abroad for these programs amount to billions of dollars and far exceed the allocations allocated for this purpose in our country," said a representative of the 3rd Central Research Institute of the Russian Ministry of Defense.

	<text>Despite the name, pseudo-dogs are not descended from dogs, but from wolves. The wild animals that inhabited the forests of the Zone at the time of the catastrophe were the ancestors of one of the most dangerous mutant species. Pseudo-dogs are as unlike mutant dogs as wild wolves are unlike mongrels. These creatures are territorial and fiercely attack anyone who trespasses on their domain. Their lightning-fast reaction, incredible agility and sharp teeth make the pseudo-dog a very formidable foe, and difficult to resist even a large mutant or heavily armed stalker. Their habitat includes most locations from Cordon to Pripyat inclusive. In the depths of the Zone one can meet the most mature specimens capable of summoning mental kin.</text>

	<text>A large beast reaching up to 1.5 m at the withers. This beast surpasses its relatives outside the Zone in sturdiness and aggressiveness, and is equal to most mutants. The mutagenic processes caused by radiation and anomalies have greatly affected the appearance of these mammals: in some places they went bald, in other places, they grew very long and tough fur. Hooves of the animals changed their shape and became sharper, gaining some resemblance to claws, pupils became discolored, and the bald head showed pigmentation spots and deep wrinkles. Zona boars have a good tolerance for radiation, allowing them to remain in heavily contaminated areas for long periods of time. They will attack from a running start, attempting to rifle through their prey's abdomen with their fangs or knocking them down. They are found in almost all locations near the boundaries of the Zone.</text>

	<text>Once in the Zone, domestic pigs, like many other living things, have been severely mutated. As the genes controlling metabolic processes were affected, the phenotype of the animal changed dramatically. The mutated pig, which stalkers call flesh, is one of the clearest examples of the Zone's abuse of nature. These creatures have formed a scaly-bony protective covering, the body's regenerative capacity has greatly increased, and their nervous system has become more complex. Like the average pig, flesh-eaters are omnivorous, so they are quite apt to attack stalkers when they are hungry. Its range is similar to that of Blind Dogs and Wild Boars.

It is not yet possible to determine the species from which the Zona tushkana evolved, all that can be said is that their ancestors were gregarious animals, most likely rodents. Reaching up to 40 centimeters at the withers, they are much more mobile, agnivorous and voracious than the desert animals. They live mostly in dungeons and ruined buildings, feeding on everything they encounter - from plants to stalkers. Sometimes even large animals and mutants fall prey to them: attacking in large packs, they can easily tear apart any creature that didn't manage to escape. A rather rare species in the Zone. Tushkans have been seen in the Wilderness Area, in the Dark Valley, and in Pripyat.</text>

Their lightning-fast reflexes and hypertrophied muscles allow them to make long, accurate jumps that tear their prey to shreds in a matter of seconds.

The most amazing thing about the bloodsucker is its ability to become invisible. It appears that these creatures are responsible for the deaths of a large number of stalkers.

They are fast and weak individually, but if you meet a pack of cats, you'd better put a bullet in your forehead. Presumably their habitat is similar to that of blind dogs, wild boars and flesh-eaters.</text>

	<text>Unknown mutations. Either the result of experiments or the effect of the Zone on the remaining humans. Hypertrophy of the limb. - Telepathy. - Face close to human. - Cunning. - Slouching and hiding his pseudo-tip under his cloak. Resembles a hunchbacked drifter from afar. Tries to lure stalkers with conversation or a request. When their backs are turned he straightens up and attacks them with his hypertrophied limb. Sharing food can provide interesting information about the Zone. Eats rats, dogs, flesh. Can chase the player with some probability. Presumably lives in the Agroprom Research Institute and Wild Territory. Tends to be close to where stalkers congregate.</text>

	<text>Exposure to the Brain Burner completely destroys the personality structure, leaving only the physical shell. After wandering around the Zone for a while, mindless bodies begin to morph into true zombies. Their reflexes are primitive, their weapons and clothes soon become useless. The result is that zombies are nothing more than slow-moving corpses with only two effective stimuli: food and sleep. Zombies are totally indiscriminate in their choice of food and drink, so their bodies are literally drenched in radiation and toxins. These creatures generally wander aimlessly through the Zone, or lie like corpses inside abandoned buildings. But as soon as a zombie senses a living human's proximity, it will attack. The experienced stalkers try to avoid these clumsy, devastated shells. Presumably in the vicinity of the fiery energy sources...</text>

	<text>No one can tell you exactly where this one-and-a-half-metre monster came from. No one will even be able to remember where it came from. But its image is remembered by many stalkers who have ever been on a deep raid... Advanced stalkers believe it is a genetic mutant with telepathic abilities, bred by the military. Scientists think it's another degree of controller evolution. But neither the former nor the latter have dared to descend into the dark vaults and dungeons where the Burer resides and ask him himself... Supposedly living in underground laboratories, basements and natural caves.</text>

	<text>The result of genetic experiments on the "universal defence animal" programme (WOW). Very intelligent, strong and fast creature. Hides, flanks on its back. Duplicated internal organ system and extra brain makes killing it very problematic. Regeneration. Few biological enemies. Resembles a panther in movement. The only decent opponents in the zone world are the Chernobyl dog and the pseudo-giant.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_b11_doc2_17">
	<text>Ugly yellow-and-white dwarfs live in dungeons, their light-sensitive eyes blind under bright light. Dungeons lay traps for stalkers and scientists. Dwarves also attempt to block all exits with large debris, rubble, and beams. The dwarves have powerful arms that they use to tear apart their victims. The dwarves wage war with the blind dogs. Their character is extremely vile, their nervous anger causing them to do wild and unexpected things. Their premonition and telekinetic abilities are strongly developed. A precognition allows them to sense their enemies without visual contact and predict their current location, while telekinesis allows them to manipulate large enough objects from a distance to hurl them at the enemy or deal a powerful telekinetic blow to an opponent. Their abilities, temperament and advanced intelligence make them one of the most dangerous opponents in the Dark Zone. Presumably in underground labs, basements and natural caves.</text>

	<text>Large and aggressive rat-like creatures. In times of famine they devour their fellows. Usually there is one rat wolf for every ten rats in a flock.

	<text>After the disaster, many animals died or left the Zone. The remaining rats multiplied, becoming the most numerous animals in the Zone. Rats are found in packs, and on rare occasions, they can be found alone. Rats sense dangerous areas and try to avoid them, warning their fellows by squeaking. They are very sentient creatures and will try to attack their prey from different directions. A victim surrounded on all sides has very little chance of survival. Presumably in underground laboratories, basements and natural caves.</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_faction_mar_b11_doc2_1">
	<text>Several generations have already passed since the first catastrophe, and each generation has increasingly been influenced by the Zone. Mutations and evolutionary adaptation have increased the formerly weak canine abilities, often to the detriment of the usual ones. Vision was the primary physiological change, as it was rendered almost useless by the sudden increase in their sense of smell: for example, blind pups survived the Zone no worse or even better than their sighted counterparts. As a result, normal dogs soon became extinct here, giving way to a new breed - the blind dogs. Like their ancestors, Blind Dogs hunt in packs: encountering a large group of these creatures is a serious danger even to a well-armed stalker. They can be found in almost every location but Pripyat and ChAES.</text>

Any kind. For example, a minor cut, a bullet wound, lacerations or torn limb in an anomaly - one just rub the artifact and bind it to the wound and in a few seconds the bleeding stops, the pain disappears, the affected area becomes numb as after the injection of novocaine. The effect ends after an hour, after the artifact has melted.</text>

	<text>The iridescent sphere is the size of an apple and slowly rotates about a meter and a half above the ground. It emits a thin, barely audible squeak. Has zero gravity, offers weak protection from psi interference, and becomes very hot in areas with high radiation backgrounds. Maternal anomaly: Orchestra (Echo). Selling price is high. Of interest to scientists, collectors. The aftermath of an experiment on mutated human embryos has yielded fruitful results. The mutant specimens bred had truly unique properties. The subject obtained an innate resistance to psi-environment and radiation of any intensity. The altered gene structure allowed the creatures to create a specific aura of semi-electrical and thermal nature around themselves. Further research in this area will be carried out on the other three main areas and is subject to classification.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_stalker">
	<text>The most adequate guys in the community without any ideological fears or global goals. Earn their daily bread by searching for artifacts or collecting mutant spare parts needed by national and world science. They set up camps, staging posts and trading posts that they carefully defend from local scavengers or ill-wishers. The only people among the latter are criminals and the military, while the rest maintain normal relations. The only thing that spoils the impression is the preponderance of newcomers in the environment. If it is not a sin to talk to promising characters and give advice, then you can meet some half-wits who have only to live until the first anomaly or pack of hungry dogs, or else they might even stumble and bump their heads and lose their breath. The only way to help them is to kick them out of the Zone.</text>

The impression is that they are only busy busy with beating their backsides and drinking to the health of all. But they only appear so on the surface, but in fact they are really battle-hardened stalkers. They have a lot of experience and courage. Waistcoats and weapons are equipped with the smartest that can be found. On the other hand, they generally prefer light, long-range weapons, so they use sniper rifles or Nato rifles with electronic upgrade. Also, they chose less heavy armour at the expense of bullet resistance, but it is not so restrictive. If they prefer it that way, so help them God. Although it would be very interesting to know who supplies them with such weapons, and some smokes too. Interesting sponsors.</text>

	<text>An incredibly mysterious and secretive community. Normally, all it takes is a couple of PDAs off a corpse and you get a pretty big picture. Here, however, there is zero information about the base and numbers, the leaders, and the scope of activities, in terms of which cases they take on and which they reject. Virtually nothing is known about them! But this only fuels interest and curiosity. The only thing that is clear is that there are some middlemen between them and the clients, through whom all the deals are done. But how to find these informants or dealers is also cryptic. The impression is that reputable merchants like Sidorovich and the leaders of the groups possess this information, but keep their mouths shut about it because of certain conditions of non-disclosure. It would be interesting to get acquainted with these conditions. In general, everything looks like a natural guild, and not just a bunch of assholes who joined a faction for the sake of fun. Most likely, even the people are monitored and selected secretly, and not just forced to read the oath. You don't just join the ranks. You live your life and travel around, and one day you come across a note in your backpack with an invitation to meet and discuss opportunities for cooperation. Although this is speculation and fairy tales, I don't really know anything.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_monolith">
	<text>Rumours and horror stories abound about these shifty weirdos, about this de facto personal guard of the Monolith, if there is such a thing. Some sectarians wandered around, praying to the stone from the Otherworld that materialized, or fell from the sky into the heart of the Zone. They worshipped it and believed that the rock rewarded true believers with the fulfilment of their heart's desire. They hovered around the Burning Man, and one day they all raced through the radiation to the station. It was like a mass suicide. However, a few months later the nutcases came back alive! They just blew their minds completely, went crazy and are killing all infidels indiscriminately. Starting from the radar scaffolding up to the station, they control every path, guarding their stone from encroachments at the price of their lives. No one knows how they manage to survive the inordinate levels of psi radiation, but after the return of these idol worshipers Stalkers seriously began to talk about the Monolith as a reality. It seems that if it were not for this stone, the pilgrims would have perished, and if they had returned, then it turns out that something mystical exists in the centre. Maybe so, but a bullet to the forehead has so far calmed these enlightened people down, which suits me just fine.</text>
</string>	
<string id="enc_faction_army">
	<text>Most of them are just serving their time here, and therefore have no enthusiasm for risking their skins to exterminate undesirable elements in the form of our stalker brother. In other words, they do not proactively scuttle deep into the Zone in platoons, and only for accountability purposes do they occasionally arrange helicopter raids and mow down anyone in hot pursuit. Extremely rarely, I have not observed it myself, but people told me that the soldiers deploy serious operations with the aim of capturing certain objects. Probably, they are searching for the reasons of the catastrophe. But such operations are conducted not by ordinary conscripts, but by shapely special divisions with appropriate arms and equipment. No matter how one turns it, this does not happen very often, so one need not fear such tricks. Usually, they sit at checkpoints 24 hours a day, shooting at pedestrians with machine guns.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_ecolog">
	<text>The most lucrative and harmless orders you can get from them. They are interested in mutants, preferably dead and cut up for parts. They're constantly learning different traits and need material all the time. As far as I know, I did not catch that time, earlier they were oriented on artifacts, people fused hundreds of these boulders to them. However, they are not organic fabrics, which means that you can pick them up for a long time before they are worn out. Although people still buy them now, but the prices are ordinary. They have nothing to do with local squabbles and wars, which is the only reason why these intellectuals are so profitable. In general, they are very cynical and indifferent simpletons. People are esteemed as expendable material, the achievement of the most incomprehensible goal justifies any sacrifice.</text>

	<text>(13:42, August 14, 2008) Now I get it, how it all happened and why those guys call themselves “Final Day.” They really are set on causing the end of the world. I remember how after meeting that bloodsucker, they gave me blood and protection. They also told me all their secrets. At first, I thought they were insane, but now I realize how wrong I was.</text>

I wonder why he’s suddenly so interested in those psy-emissions. He even said that soon enough he’ll have a prototype that can protect one from them.

	<text>(13:42, February 15, 2009) Mark told me all about Clear Sky and it turns out that both Lebedev and Beanpolev are with them. The faction is, scientifically, very capable, and they’re already on the right path. However, at the same time, they seem to be missing what’s right in front of them. It’s strange, why haven’t they joined the C-Consciousness? Mark also told me that their base is located somewhere in the south of the Zone.</text>

	<text>(13:42, February 23, 2009) We have some serious problems. We found out that there’s a group of stalkers out there who are planning to reach the Zone’s center. At first, it would seem as though this isn’t a big deal as there were many groups like it before. However, this group is being aided by the Swamp Doctor which means they have a real chance of going through with what they’re planning. Damn it, they don’t have the slightest clue how much damage their actions are going to cause. As of now, we know of only one stalker from said group: Ghost. We need to find and put him down.</text>

	<text>- Kolya Vorchun..." the interrogator - a young lieutenant, smoothly shaven, trim, stern. He tapped the table with the tip of his pencil and looked at the prisoner with a light disdain. - Why did he get such a nickname? Probably you like to complain of life, as all your stalker brethren.
Nikolai glanced sourly at the lieutenant.
- It's not a nickname," he said quietly. - It's my surname.
The interrogator grinned, then became serious at once.
- Now, Kolya...hmm...Grumpy, so as not to waste any time, let's get to the point of our conversation. I need to know when and where to find the stalker who calls himself Bold. That's why I'm here, and the same reason you're in this room.
The lieutenant nodded to someone behind Grumpy's back. The stalker realized what was about to happen and instinctively shrank back, as much as the cramped hands behind his back allowed. A hard blow to the back of the head made his eyes blacken for a few seconds.
Kolya shook his head, driving away the haze that obscured his vision, then turned his head towards the soldier who had hit him and said over his shoulder:
- Thanks, bro, respect.
The back of the stalker's ear stiffened and a trickle of blood began to trickle down his neck.
- Just to be clear," the interrogator spoke again, "I'm not joking.
- No jokes," Nikolai looked at him. - Jokes are usually laughed at, and I don't feel like it right now.
The lieutenant leaned back in his chair in a relaxed pose, interlocking his fingers.
- You're a shrewd fellow, I see. I'll tell you what I know, and then you tell me what I want to know," he stared at Grumpy for a few seconds, waiting for an answer, and, taking his silence as agreement, continued: - Now, I know that you and Bold went on a number of raids together, which in itself is an interesting fact, considering that your friend is a loner and seldom takes on second helpers. There's no doubt that you were his assistant, and not the other way around, otherwise I'd be questioning him and not you. There's also some information that you were involved in the gang war, and that you two were the ones who eliminated Sutulogo's gang and got their hands on all the loot they'd stolen. But I don't care about looters and your stalker crap. And that was until last week, when you bastards attacked the roadblock, shooting five young boys...
The lieutenant couldn't help himself, and his face contorted into a grimace of anger.
Stalker lowered his gaze and muttered:
- I did not give them machine guns in their hands and did not drag them into the Zone.
- Shut your mouth! - The interrogator bellowed and slammed his hand on the table. - You did not drag and I did not drag! They're here to keep the rest of the world safe from all this filth you bugs are swarming around in! You vultures, all you do is kill each other and line your pockets ....
The Lieutenant stopped abruptly, as if ashamed of having let his emotions get the better of him, quickly pulled himself together, leaned back in his chair and continued as calmly as before:
- Now it's your turn. Well... I'm listening.
- You may listen," Grumpy grinned sadly, "but I have nothing to say. I don't know shit.
- Uh-huh," said the interrogator. He waited a while, then nodded, as if in answer to his own thoughts, and said: - 'Not good, then. Well, well...
He glanced at the soldier behind the stalker and gave the order to begin.
Strangely enough, I did not find Grumpy in his usual place today. The last three times I visited the Zone, we constantly met him, and always in this very spot. But today the stalker was gone.
Just in case, I walked around the dilapidated hut. Just in case! Maybe his mortal body was lying in the corner, mauled by blind dogs or other mutants. He's no friend of mine, but we've done a few quests together, and he helped me well last time at the checkpoint. The merchant, however, did not tell me what kind of device we took from the soldiers. He silently took the case, counted out the money, and instead of saying 'thank you', he told me to bugger off and not to show my face for a while.
But I wasn't offended - it was a good raid, I made some money and got a AK with optics. It is a pity, that Grumpy is not here today, he covered me well....
Well, never mind. No need to grieve!
So, what shall we do today? I remember Bury said he had a job for me. It would be nice to make some money, because I had a suit from the merchant, reinforced, with an air recirculation system, but the price is too steep. And Brown promised to pay good money....
I slung the submachine gun over my shoulder, took out my binoculars, fumbled for the bolts in my pocket, readjusted my duffel bag, and headed for Bury's lair.
The cold ground chilled my body, even through the thick fabric of my overalls. But the lieutenant paid no attention to such trifles.
"Kolya Grumpy didn't lie... here comes the bastard, here comes..." - sprawled at the top of the hill, the soldier was looking at the stalker through powerful binoculars with anti-reflective coating.
He turned to the sergeant stationed nearby.
- Stand by! And tell the boys not to be a hero, let's cover him before he goes behind the trees...
Suddenly shots rang out from the direction where Bold walked. The Lieutenant immediately drew his gaze back to the binoculars.
- The lieutenant drew the binoculars again. - He couldn't help it.
He could see from above, a pack of wild dogs charging at the stalker. Two animals Bold put with his Makarov, the rest scattered to the sides, hiding in the tall grass. Then the dogs turned around and attacked again.
The stalker's actions caused the lieutenant involuntary admiration: clear sparing movements, accurate shots. Bold, slowly retreating and trying not to allow them to come to him in the back, effectively discharged his "PM" in the nearest predators, slashed his knife leaping at him a dog, immediately put his "Kalashnikov" to his shoulder, stopped and took down several animals in short bursts.
- It works fine," muttered the sergeant, watching with the lieutenant.
- Beautiful?! Just as 'beautiful' he was killing our lads! - The officer snarled. - Start the operation!
- Aye," the sergeant replied and slowly made his way down to where a squad of fighters was waiting for him.
The lieutenant looked at the stalker again, and again cursed - Bold ran towards the trees, before the retreating pack decided to make another attack.
What a day! The pack was upon him! You can't see these creatures in the grass, you can't see them fast enough to see how many dogs are barking and whining all around you. I should have run, but I thought I'd slap a couple of 'em and the rest would run away. Yeah! No way! I shot the first two, and the rest almost got torn apart. Barely got away!
The adrenaline of the fight was still burning my veins, but oddly enough, I was in a good mood... But why the oddity? He was alive, you could say he had come out of the fight victorious.
By the way, need to reload the gun, because the "PM" is empty, and in the "gun" is less than half a magazine, and to Bury still stomp and stomp.
I listened: the pack had decided not to follow. That was good!
Slowing down, I regained my breath. I staggered around the trees and over snags as I took my time to change the clip of my pistol and habitually filled the magazine of my rifle with ammunition.
The pursuit was dragging on, and this annoyed the lieutenant. Bold was slowly but surely getting away from them.
No! He must not be allowed to escape! Otherwise we'll have to track him again and wait for him to deign to appear in the Zone.
- Faster, lads, faster! - He hurried his men.
Bright lightning cut through the sky. Seconds later, thunder boomed over the soldiers' heads. Heavy drops slammed on the ground, causing the tall grass to bow down, and gradually the spreading rain created a gray veil, hiding the stalker from his pursuers.
"Just don't let go, just don't let go..." - muttered the lieutenant to himself.
But good luck accompanied them: rounding another hill, the military came to the outskirts of an abandoned village. Of most of the houses remained only rotten debris, gray-black teeth sticking out in the middle of their engulfing vegetation. Only a few huts were more or less intact. Near one of them, the lieutenant walking ahead spotted the men and immediately ordered the men to lay low.
The sergeant got close to him and whispered:
- Well?
- Eight men...
- Well, and this... there?
The lieutenant, still looking at the stalker through the binoculars for the first time, noted to himself his unremarkable appearance. He was almost no different from the other stalkers - similar jacket and backpack behind him, a hood slung over his head, standard equipment ... but also confuse him with no one - something in the movements, habits, manner of conduct, stood out Bold among the others.
 There. Third from the left, talking to the tall one.
- I see him. You got him?
But the lieutenant did not answer at once, he was cursing to himself again:
"Damn you! Missed a good moment! And now the bastard is not alone! Joined some gang. They're making some kind of deal, planning something... If you go through with it, you might get shot."
- Sergeant, do you have a marksman in your unit?
- We got one.
- See that house over there where half the roof collapsed? Point him there.
- Not a good position," the sergeant assessed. - Trees are in the way. And it's a big distance - we ain't got an SVD.
- The main thing is to keep his head down. Bold is his target. Don't pay any attention to the others. We'll draw him out in the meantime.
- Understood," nodded the sergeant and crept back to give orders.
Time dragged on like molten caramel and the lieutenant trembled with impatience, but he waited for the signal from the sniper.
Finally the long-awaited words came from the radio: "In position".
Through the binoculars, the officer saw the Bold one startled. He began to look around, grabbed his machine gun, and the other stalkers became alarmed along with him.
"They're listening to our wave!" - the lieutenant guessed.
- 'Come on, Sergeant, let's go, let's go! - He raised his automatic rifle and fired at the enemy.
In position".
It didn't immediately dawn on me that it was my radio.
I looked questioningly at Brown, who gave me the same surprised look.
- Soldiers! - I thought to myself, glancing around.
The boys started to look round too, when shots were fired at us from behind the houses at the end of the village.
I rushed for cover. The boards of the fence behind me shattered into splinters. Crouching down, I ducked behind Bury and crouched by the window. The bullets whistled and squealed, piercing the boards, shattering the window frames, shattering the remains of the furniture....
Putting my rifle to my shoulder, I began to scout for targets.
The soldiers were attacking from behind a thicket of neglected hedges, and their location could only be determined by the flashes of gunfire. I aimed a little to the side, where I thought one of the shooters might be, and fired a short burst. Then another.
There were no more shots from that spot, but the window that had served as my embrasure was rained down in a hail of bullets. I moved to the other window without getting up and fixed my sights again. I found another shooter and was just about to pull the trigger, when someone's back covered my line of fire.
Burogo's boys had decided not to hide, but to go on the offensive.
Bad tactics!
- Where are you going! You idiots! - I shouted.
The battle was shifted to a close range. The Stalker rifles clattered a few times before they went silent.
One by one they were shot, leaving only Bury, who was wise enough to stay out of the fray. Where did he find such idiots?! Young boys, just got into the Zone, and now permanently remain in it!
I peered out cautiously.
Soldiers, scattered and pressed against the fences, were moving through the village in our direction.
I counted five of them, led by an officer.
The rain was not good at all! I could hardly see anything at all.
The troops were keeping to the right where the trees were blocking them. We must change the position. I was already working out a plan of action in my head: get out of the house, hide behind the fence, kill a couple, get back in the house, come out the other side, find somewhere to hide again and carefully shoot them one by one. It was like a game of catch-up - the main thing was to escape in time.
There was no point in waiting any longer. Crouching down and trying not to make noise, I got out of the house. At that moment Bury played into my hands. The stalker hid in the bushes of wild raspberries and opened fire, thus diverting attention to himself. Great!
I peered out through the gap between the boards - the two military men appeared to be open. Putting the Kalashnikov to my shoulder, I took aim at the officer. Through the optics I could see the lieutenant's stars on his shoulder straps. The centre of the crosshairs was exactly above the bridge of his nose.
"Now you're going to get an olive from me..."
The enemy bullet came from somewhere to the right. The blunt blow knocked me sideways, there was no pain, only the sensation of being hit.
My finger squeezed the trigger, but I was no longer firing at the target, but upwards.
"What a creature! I flanked it!" - the thought crossed my mind. Immediately, following the first one, two more bullets found me.
I stretched out on the ground, feeling my life slipping away so fast. Everything before my eyes blurred, the shadows deepened, the sky turned crimson...
- Target down," came the sniper's voice over the radio.
- Well done! - The lieutenant sincerely admired his work. - Sergeant, deal with this stalker already. There is no bold, you can not be so careful.
- Got it. We'll be done in a moment.
The officer waited until the shooting subsided, and the sergeant reported the completion of the operation. Then he straightened up and headed over to where Bold was lying. The lieutenant was not a coward, but approached them cautiously - he could be only wounded, there was no point in taking unnecessary risks.
But Bold was dead. He was lying on his back, arms outstretched, his eyes fixed on the gray sky.</text>

	<text>The calendar winter was in its second decade, but it was behaving like a lazy bum. No frost, or at least no apparent cold, not a single snowflake or gust of north wind. Low, gray clouds hung over the zone, drizzling rain, and sometimes a thick layer of frost covered tree branches and grass in some sectors. That was about all there was to it. Numerous bodies of water remained free of ice and the ground was slick with greasy mud. So there was not much difference from autumn yet.
"The day has become shorter," still Major Brazhnikov found a significant difference. - Otherwise... an orphan winter, bad quality. It's like at home in Siberia. It's been white there for a month already. Well, almost. Apart from cityscapes, especially Kuzbass ones near coal mines and open pits. But even there it is freezing. It's the tenth of December. It's time for the first wave of real frosts.
The major turned around and gestured to his men to disperse. Behind the chain of commandos the grey whale carcasses of two choppers could be seen. Fountains of spinning blades that gleamed silver over the humpbacked backs of the helicopters added to the resemblance. Only the heavy sighs and splashes were absent. There were few sounds at all. The hum of the engines and the whistling of the air cleared by the blades were uncharacteristic of these helicopter models. How the designers managed to achieve this effect was always a mystery to Brazhnikov, but the fact remained - the helicopters were considered almost silent, just right for covert operations. Go to the base "board" was not going to, they just obeyed the order not to muffle the engines just in case. The Zone is the Zone, here it is necessary to be constantly on the alert. All the more so when they had arrived in the operational area on such an alarming "readout".
The thought of the danger pervading the Zone made the Major look over the surroundings once again. Previously he had only come to this area as part of foot groups. Sometimes he managed to travel part of the way by car, but on the southwestern outskirts of Chernobyl he had to dismount and pound the eternal mud with his boots. Once managed to penetrate the area adjacent to this sector Leleva by water, but that was an exceptional case. Almost as exceptional as it is now, when the special forces risked to land on the bank of the former Chernobyl cooling pond in the Kopacz sector. Even in the faint light of a foggy day, almost at dusk, the station's exhaust pipe was clearly visible to the north, and to the west, among the foliage-lost but still dense thickets, the mounds above the ruins of the settlement could be discerned. Most of the houses of the dead settlement were covered with earth after the first disaster, when they unsuccessfully tried to defend the zone (not with a capital letter then) in the fight against radiation. That battle was lost cleanly and almost at once, and therefore the liquidators did not bury the village of Kopachi completely, as much as they could. Until now, a dozen lopsided wooden buildings and carcasses of a couple of stone buildings have survived among trees grown out for less than three decades by the road from Chernobyl to Pripyat. In one of them, a former kindergarten, raiding parties of soldiers often arranged operative headquarters, and generally it was considered to be the centre of the sector, a kind of a meeting point in unforeseen situations.
Today a group of special forces landed far away from the road, but even from this angle Kopaci was not new to the major. He immediately spotted familiar landmarks and determined the direction of the search. Strictly to the north, along the coast, about three hundred metres. It was there, according to intelligence reports, that illegal artifact dealers had set up a temporary transshipment depot, near which the military had problems during the sweep. According to the officer on duty, the penultimate report from the cleaner's commander left no doubt that the unit was on target. But the next report was not so cheerful. More to the point, it was confused and unclear.
"Shouted that they got into a big meat grinder, asked for a helicopter," handed a sheet with a short prescription, added the duty officer. - Look out there, work carefully, don't get into it either..."
Brazhnikov tried to clarify what the commander of the "cleaners" meant by the word "meat grinder" and whether he mentioned the superior enemy forces, but the duty officer only shrugged his shoulders. The ISI chief of staff, who unexpectedly appeared in his own superior person in time for the departure of the special forces, did not clarify the situation either. Only repeated the request of the duty officer to work without smartening and wished him good luck.
The major did not object to this formulation of the task, in principle. In this situation it was more important to arrive at the square as quickly as possible, and then to sort things out on the spot. That is what the rapid reaction force is for, to respond to any irritants and sort out problems at lightning speed.
It would, however, be better to have more specific information before the operation starts. At least an update on abnormal activity in the sector. To be involved in any rubbish (even the simplest "Carousel" - already a problem) on approach or at the moment of a landing could be easily. The eternal twilight due to low clouds and lousy weather was quite conducive to this.
Fortunately for the group the helicopters landed successfully, no anomalies were detected either by detectors or professional intuition, and with mutants in the sector everything was normal. On the one hand such sterile cleanliness of the territory was pleasant, but on the other hand it was alarming. At any rate it was not relaxing. From his own experience Brazhnikov knew that "cleanliness" in the Zone - the first sign of approaching big trouble. And the cleaner now, the bigger trouble will come later. Animals and anomalies completely disappeared from the sector only in two cases: if the Zone was going to close it for preservation or if the formation of another anomaly, more powerful and larger than all existing here "Ramps", "Funnels" and "Carousels" taken together.
The Major cast a glance at the detector screen. The device wasn't picking up any serious anomalous energy perturbations yet, but that didn't mean anything. Electronics works strictly according to the programs, and they are written by people. And people do not yet fully understand the Zone, that is, not able to take into account everything. He could rely on his gut feeling, which told Brazhnikov that the problems were sure to start, but there was still time.
Brazhnikov checked the airwaves - silence - and beckoned his men to do so. The group immediately moved towards the warehouse. The object was carefully camouflaged, from the side - overgrown with bushes, which here in abundance, but it gave two obvious things: a rolling road leading to hidden in the bushes of the main gate, and a small but clearly working pier at the gate auxiliary, overlooking the pond.
The greasy mud mud hindered footsteps from moving swiftly and stealthily, clumping on boots and chomping treacherously, but the moaning of the weak wind beneath the trees and the chill of the waves cut off all sound of disguise. A pity it was only to approach, not to penetrate.
At the last moment, when the gate was no more than fifty meters away, one of the fighters on the left flank stumbled and fell in the mud on one knee. The Major turned to the intruder and froze, staring intensely into the semi-darkness. No, the fighter was all right, he got up quickly, but for some reason he did not move on. Brazhnikov glanced over the area in front of frozen in indecision warrior. The essence of the fighter's doubts became clear at a glance. His way was blocked by a real blockage of human bodies. About two dozen dead bodies were lying in a heap, in different positions in an area of thirty square meters.
The Major gestured for the group to stop and slowly approached the carnage.
The men had died recently, and a slight smoke could be seen over some of the bodies. It smoked from the lacerations, most likely left by beasts, but Brazhnikov was somehow certain that the mutants had arrived at the ready. This was evidenced by the fact that the scavengers were frightened and took off at the sound of a new group of people approaching. No true predators would have left their prey behind.
The Major crouched down beside the nearest corpse. It, unlike the others, had no visible injuries. Brazhnikov tried to feel for a pulse, but found none. However, the skin was supple and still warm. It appeared that the SWAT team was a few minutes too late. That was a shame. Particularly because all the dead were, as one, their own.
The Major stood up and glanced around the area again. He spotted another cluster of bodies about twenty meters to the south, and a third was signaled to him by a fighter on his right flank. Brazhnikov suddenly realized that the bodies lay equidistant from where the Major had been standing a minute before, at the moment when the left flanker stumbled. Brazhnikov returned to his former position and saw several more bodies from it.
These dead were also armed, but not dressed in camouflage, most likely warehouse guards. And they weren't lying in heaps, but forming a distinct semi-circle. The Major turned half a turn, then again, completing the panoramic view, and shifted his gaze to his feet. It looked as if all those people had been killed in an instant by some explosion, which broke out on the very spot where Brazhnikov was standing now. However, neither a crater nor any other signs of an explosion could be found by the special forces commander, no matter how hard he tried.
"An anomaly? - thought Brazhnikov, finally stumbling upon some suspicious dark spot two paces away from himself. It differed only an iota from the surrounding dirt, but still with a saturation of colour. - If an anomaly, then a previously unknown one. It would be interesting to know if it produces artifacts?"
Brazhnikov glanced once more at the black stain in the middle of the conventional circle and felt a slight prick of intuition. The stain had increased. Not much, but still. Whatever it was - the artifact of an unknown anomaly production, a residual phenomenon or another phase of an anomalous process, one should not linger in the danger zone.
The Major gave the go-ahead and the group moved towards the gate. They should not linger, that was true, but they should perform the task. The order to rescue survivors had not been rescinded. Maybe all the cleaners were lying here, around the circumference of the strange blackmarked clearing, but that was only a theorem that had to be proven.
The warehouse gate was ajar, and inside, apart from the ubiquitous rats, not a single living soul was to be found. The group walked quickly along the length of the room, checking every nook and cranny and peering under each of the dozens of shelves littered with merchandise, but found no one. In the back wall of the warehouse were three open doors. The central one, the widest, double-winged, opened into a corridor that ended at a spare gate, the other two leading to stairs. The left one led up the stairs, which in turn led to a small storage office, the right one down. As Brazhnikov guessed, the "temporary" warehouse turned out to be very substantial, with three underground levels. On the "underground" level food and belongings were stored, and the first from the surface revealed a small arsenal. Nobody was there, neither guards nor loaders. On "minus two", boxes of artefacts were stored in a working mess, and on the third was completely empty, just shelving.
On closer inspection Brazhnikov found traces of recent repairs there. Apparently this level was going to be loaded with goods any day now, but not in time. But clearly they had fought a war on this level, and a serious one at that. In the far corner of the room, not far from the ajar grate over the sewer, lay three "drank out" bodies and six inhuman corpses: the controller and five bloodsuckers. Given the species characteristics of these mutants, it was strange to see them around, even dead, but the fact, as they say, was there, and there was no getting away from it. The mutants had all been killed in the same scuffle - the Major leaned over and picked up one of the many shell casings lying nearby - and with the same kind of weapon. Judging by the placement of the casings, four or five barrels had been fired, all special, Val or Vintorez.
"Did the cleaners send a task force through the sewer? It's possible. Only where are the specialists? The three dry ones? No, they died first, then the mutants. And at the gate there are fighters with conventional weapons. Couldn't the specialists have gone through the sewer the way they came in? But why not? If a serious anomaly raged before the main gate, they could take the back route.
Brazhnikov knelt down and peered into the sewer. The NV illumination allowed to see the tunnel only a few meters, in fact - at an arm's length from the grating. In order to test the new theory, they had to go down into the tunnel. The Major did not want to make life difficult for himself and his subordinates, so he decided to limit himself to a flare. He lit the torch and, hovering over the tunnel gap, tossed it as far away as possible.
There was no sound in the tunnel except the hiss of the flare. Not even a rat rustled. This meant that if they had gone this way, they had done so long ago, and had probably made it to the surface somewhere by now. Having calmed himself with this conclusion, Brazhnikov got up from his knees and gestured for his men to move in the opposite direction.
There was no one to save at the illegal warehouse near Kopachi. Fact.
Brazhnikov left the gloomy warehouse bunker last, as if the captain of a sinking ship. The distant resemblance was reinforced, on the one hand, by the proximity of the vast water area of the cooling pond, and on the other... by the lazily rippling, like an oil slick, huge and unnaturally round puddle in front of the gates of the storage area. It took the Major a moment to realize the sudden expanse of spilled oil, but he knew instantly that he shouldn't tread in the strange puddle. He caught up with the rest of the fighters at the gate and rummaged in his pocket. Best friend of the stalker, and any other walker in the Zone - the bolt was found immediately. Brazhnikov threw it almost in the middle of a puddle, watched for a moment as the rainbow bubble above the fall and burst, and then lifted a wistful gaze to the sky, slightly cleared under the onslaught of increased wind. It was unknown if the black muck would pour inside the warehouse, but planning further action had to be based on a worst-case scenario. There was nothing to plan for. There was only one way out, not counting the sewer, and that was through the emergency gate. As before, without uttering a word, Brazhnikov pointed to the far end of the warehouse.
The dock, thank goodness, was free of anomalies. The men made their way down to the shore at a brisk pace, walked along the water's edge to a small beach, littered with rubbish, and set course for the choppers.
The Major, as was his habit, closed the column, moreover, even lagged a little behind the group. Frankly speaking, he did not want to leave empty-handed. It is clear that he did not feel any guilt. Spetsnaz came as quickly as possible, exceeding all standards, and if there was a normal mess, at least half of the "cleaners" was realistic. But... everything unusual in the Zone is just unusual. To be in time to help people caught in an anomaly, it is rarely possible, even being from them in a hundred meters, let alone half an hour of summer? So it wasn't a matter of guilt, but of a quality attitude to the job. Formally Brazhnikov was required to follow orders and get away, and if the mission was not possible, then simply to get away, without unnecessary gestures. But Brazhnikov, as a thinking and inquisitive officer, could not afford such directness. Nor was it welcomed in the Special Forces. Especially after the detachment was headed by former military guide, now Colonel Bibik. According to his unofficial order, each soldier, and even more so the commander of the group, encountering a new anomaly, was simply obliged to see and remember as much as possible. And even better - to get something related to it: an artifact or at least clues that characterize it. Brazhnikov was in full agreement with such approach to the service, but in this particular case there was a lack of both artifacts and evidence. To scoop "oil" from the black spot was hardly realistic, and the major could see no other "evidence" nearby.
The first fighters had already started to load into helicopters and Brazhnikov was still halfway between the pond and helicopters as he could not resist the temptation and turned slightly to the right in order to have one last look at the black spot. It turned out that he walked to the warehouse gate by a new path, on which he unexpectedly discovered several more bodies. This time there was no doubt, the fighters had been killed with firearms. All the dead were well equipped and armed, but judging by the number of shell casings around, they had died in an unequal fight rather quickly. The Major leaned over and took a closer look at one corpse. On the sleeve a chevron of the group "Duty", a special weapon, an EMP, an isolating mask ... obviously a saboteur or a scout.
Brazhnikov straightened and rubbed his temple in puzzlement. The bodies of the Debtors lay as if they were fighting off someone coming from the side of the Kopacz. So the military were in their rear. This fact finally confused all traces and covered the picture of what had happened with a thick layer of dark substance. Like the one that splashed in the unnaturally round puddle in front of the warehouse gate.
The Major turned around and staggered down the path. The "oil spill" was still there, but seemed to have stopped growing. Brazhnikov once more probed this "anomaly rollback" with a bolt, again observed the bloated bubble and finally gave up. No survivors, no artifacts, no evidence to bring back from the raid, only impressions.
"So be it, then."
Brazhnikov shook himself off and trotted towards the nearest 'board'.
He only managed to reach the edge of the clearing, where the helicopters had landed. Here already felt a strong wind picked up by the blades of flying machines, and at first Brazhnikov did not pay much attention to the abrupt rush. But after two steps he had to stop because the wind suddenly increased so much that it was impossible to overcome its onslaught.
The major ducked and lowered the armoured glass of his helmet. It helped to reduce the noise a little, now the howling sound didn't bother his ears, but that's all. Brazhnikov backed up under the onslaught of the wind, stumbled over a bump and landed straight in the mud. He had never been caught in such a hurricane on a flat place before.
"And for no reason at all! It was quiet, almost a calm, and suddenly, here it is. Another anomaly? Isn't it too much? Third time on one square kilometre within one hour. What's really going on here?!"
There was no panic. The major had been in worse situations than this. But the feeling of helplessness - the wind literally pressed him into the mud, not allowing him even to move - was something Brazhnikov firmly disliked. The role of a bystander always bothered him. So far nothing terrible had happened and Major could calmly wait out the cataclysm lying between bumps like a grasshopper full of frogs. The boys, as far as he could see behind the cloud of wet leaves and branches lifted by the storm, were fine. Nearly everyone had sunk into the choppers and were now peering restlessly out, trying to spot the commander. But this uneven distribution of trouble was what alarmed the Major. It seemed that the storm was raging exclusively over Brazhnikov's head, while a hundred metres to the east there was the same dead calm.
"An anomaly is an anomaly... but where is the conscience?"
The major felt that the insolent wind was trying to pick up his prey and fly it far away, like Chernomor the sorcerer. Brazhnikov clung to the stunted grass and tried to press himself even tighter to the ground. To deprive the hurricane of chances for good the major even sacrificed cleanliness of his armoured glass and ducked his head down and literally hit his face (or rather helmet's visor) into the mud. The wind reluctantly retreated. Not at once, but it did loosen its frenzied onslaught, and soon died down as if it had never existed.
The Major raised his head, tried to wipe the glass, but only smeared the mud. He had to raise his visor. Then Brazhnikov understood two things: that his premonitions had not deceived him and that everything that had happened in this necropolis was a warm-up, the worst loomed ahead. Or rather, all around.
The abnormal wind had not abated. It simply wasn't blowing from the east or from any other direction but was circling Brazhnikov very specifically. The major certainly did not delude himself, it was unlikely that an anomaly was dancing a jig specially for him, it just so happened that today Brazhnikov was destined to be in the centre of events each time. First in the centre of a strange "circle of the dead", now in the centre of the wrong tornado. Moreover, the new circle was about the same diameter as the previous one - about thirty forty meters.
The Major looked around. The whirlwind was no longer playing with leaves and broken limbs. Now it was building a sort of translucent wall of tiny drops of water and liquid mud, only this wall was not gray or brown, but reddish. Brazhnikov once again appreciated the force of the raging elements and involuntarily shivered. The show was impressive, of course. The major suddenly felt the urge to get closer to the rippling wall. He took a step, but then someone touched him by the shoulder.
The Major turned around sharply. Behind him stood a man, as dirty as he was, in what looked like a mercenary's uniform. There was no way to tell for sure, the man was too filthy. The filter mask on the guy's face, on the other hand, remained relatively clean.
"A competent walker," concluded the Major. - Why didn't I notice him at once? Where was he hiding? And who did he remind me of? An acquaintance? I can't understand, only eyes are visible, and even conditionally, it's impossible to define his colour.
Behind the tinted glass it was really difficult to see the eyes of the stranger, and nevertheless it seemed to Brazhnikov that he had already met this person. And then there was this gesture... the stranger clapped him on the shoulder as if very peculiar. It would have made sense to ask "Who are you?" but through the howling wind it was impossible to hear any words at all. The wind picked up quickly and roared louder than a jetliner on take-off. Try to speak while standing thirty meters away from the runway. Sign language remained.
Brazhnikov nodded and stared questioningly at the man.
The man pointed at the mud wall, shook his head negatively and as if beckoned the wall towards him.
The Major looked around once more and understood the hidden meaning of the pantomime. The ring of a mad whirlwind was slowly shrinking. Again the association with the black spot at the warehouse gate arose. The movement of the anomaly in this case was oppositely directed, but the speed was the same. Brazhnikov involuntarily backed up to where it felt the centre of the vortex outlined circle. The stranger shook his head again negatively and gently moved aside the Major. In his opinion the centre was not to be occupied at all. Brazhnikov soon understood why.
When the vortex compressed the howling ring to a diameter of only ten meters, exactly in the centre of the circle, about thirty meters from the ground, flashed a bright scarlet flash, and in the mud fell literally out of nowhere artefact. It was the size of a fist and looked like a carelessly cut diamond of not the purest water, with a distinctly crimson hue.
Unlike "oil puddles" and "ring vortices", this creation of the Zone was familiar to the Major. He had seen such artefacts on a recent excursion to a military laboratory. Scientists claimed it was the rarest and most expensive - market price up to a million euros! - artifact produced by no less than the "Black Angel" itself, an anomaly, poorly studied and extremely dangerous, besides appearing exclusively in the centre of the Zone. That is, where they dare to go at most three people out of several tens of thousands of inhabitants of the Zone and the Borderlands.
But the dubious provenance and the artifact's frivolous price were not the strongest jokes about the reddish lump of fused glass. The funniest were the rumors that the "Joker" as the artifact was simply dubbed by the stalkers, gives an absolute protection against all evils from radiation to any anomaly, including the mother anomaly, i.e. the "Black Angel" itself, and also allows to control mutants and heals even the most severe wounds. A panacea, in a word. Plus a magic flute and Prince Julian's armour.
Brazhnikov blatant nonsense about a super artifact did not believe, and therefore not surprised to see that "Joker" in the game, but "delivers" it is not "Angel", but only a relatively harmless anomalous vortex. In fact, that's why the Major did not even move an eyebrow when the artifact was quickly picked up and slipped into the pocket of a quick stranger. Much more than a dubious artifact, the Major was concerned about the operational situation. It was, to put it mildly, shitty and was getting worse by the second. The trapped men stood shoulder to shoulder, and it was soon up to them to decide whether they would stand back to back or embrace, as if merged in a final dance. The howling circle shrank to a minimum.
"And yet the mud flying at this speed can grind just as hard as a sandblaster. Will grind us to the bone, fact. Bloody hell, I'm in trouble!"
It was unclear what the man behind the Major was thinking, but he seemed preoccupied with other matters. Or the same, but from a different perspective. He suddenly took an artifact stashed in his pocket and slipped it into Major Ah's hand. Brazhnikov looked at the man in surprise. The man gestured, "We're breaking through, you first." The Major grinned and tried to return the Joker, but the stranger blocked his hand and nodded confidently. It was strange, but Brazhnikov believed him for some reason. There was no other way to survive anyway, so why not rely on the experience of his fellow man? He seemed to know what he was talking or rather gesticulating about. Why did he cede the artifact to the Major? There was no time to think about that either. So it was necessary.
The stranger seemed to confirm the Major's conclusion, with a new gesture marking the last point of the agreement: "If we'll get through you'll return it". Brazhnikov nodded, closed his visor and prepared for a knowingly lost fight. Jumping into the roaring wall with a desperate cry was not necessary. The vortex closed its heavy arms and prepared to pencil in those who had been caught in its "sandblasting". The stranger suddenly took something out of his pocket again, stretched out his hand in front of him, stepped forward and tried to stand in front of the Major, as if to cover him, but tumbled and fell back, into the arms of Brazhnikov ...
...The first thought was simple and clear: "Alive!" The Major was lying on his back in the same cold mud, but there was no hurricane howling around him anymore, and his arms, legs and head were in place, and not shaved to the bone at all. And in general, he felt fine. Seconds later slowly but surely the next thought came: "That he is alive is good, but it is better not to lie down. Brazhnikov cautiously sat up and lifted his visor. Straight ahead was a metre high berm on which a stranger was sitting with his back to the Major.
"Have we made it through?" The Major took a cursory look at his uniform. Everything was in place. 'Sandblasting' had done almost no damage. The stranger, at least from the back, seemed fine too.
"Maybe I imagined it?"
Shadows of approaching men flashed over the parapet. Brazhnikov could not hear their footsteps, there was still a noise in his ears, but he could feel the vibration of the ground. Everyone, including the chopper pilots, seemed to be rushing to the rescue. The Major stood up and stepped towards the seated man, but suddenly froze in place. The reason for that were the faces of the commandos, who had run up to their "partners", who had escaped the anomaly. To be more precise, the expressions on their faces. Specialists who have seen a lot in the Zone, and outside it stand as if spetszyrenuvshie and stared at the sitting stranger, as if he had seen a living ghost. There was a mixture of disbelief and mild fear in the eyes of the boys. It was as if they could not believe that a man in such a condition could sit as if alive and sway gently as if cradling a pain enveloping his body. Brazhnikov walked around the stranger in a circle and joined the crowded in indecision soldiers.
This really wasn't something he saw very often. Unlike the sandblasted back and back of his head, the man's face, arms, and chest were badly injured. Neither the Kevlar wetsuit, nor the bulletproof vest, nor the helmet, nor the mask helped. More or less survived the lower part of the body (Brazhnikov had a "Freudian" thought: "Between the belt and knees all intact, and that's good"), but the face, chest and arms were turned into huge wounds, completely devoid of skin. Muscles trembled beneath the whitish fascia, the bones were white and the surviving blood vessels throbbed heavily. But the most eerie thing was the man's gaze. He stared at a single point with eyelids gone, and seemed surprised that he was still alive. The gaze of the living dead, with the gaping gap in his nose and the grin of his uncovered jaw, was doubly terrifying.
- Why do you stand, move over! - The team doctor pushed his way to the parapet. - Get the stretcher out of the chopper! Major, are you all right?
- Ah? - Brazhnikov turned his gaze to the medic. - I'm... fine. Do you think we can make it?
- It's a severe case, but there's a chance. - The doctor sat down and placed a bag of medical supplies on his lap. - If he doesn't die of painful shock on the way, he might make it. We'll have to inject him quickly, and then...
The medic shrugged.
- Well, let's do it! - Brazhnikov glanced round the glade where he'd almost died a few minutes before. Or nearly turned into such a living skeleton, which is hardly better.
A bramble stretched around the entire clearing and seemed to mark the original boundaries of the vortex. But that wasn't what the Major was interested in. He was concerned with the place where the artefact had appeared. No, not that he really cared, just... his intuition kicked in. And for good reason. Exactly in the centre of the circle there was a distinctly dark "oil" stain. So far the size of a saucer.
The Major turned to his subordinates again and gestured for them to hurry.
"The cleaners were killed by the same 'sandblaster', a fact. Not sandblasted like this guy, but in some other way, but it was exactly the same anomaly as the one that had recently raged around the Major.
"Good thing my boys got in the chopper," the thought flashed. - If they'd been any closer, they'd have gone down for some unknown reason, too. And there seems to be a kickback similar to the one at the warehouse gate.
The prospect of getting bogged down in an "oil puddle" did not make Brazhnikov feel better. For today he had exhausted his personal limit of thrills.
When the group reoccupied themselves in the helicopters the major jumped on board the second ambulance and sat down next to the stranger. The bandages the doctor had applied were drenched almost immediately, and now his unknown savior looked like a blood-soaked mummy.
Brazhnikov caught himself involuntarily calling the stranger a savior. His hand slipped into his pocket. The artefact was there. It was warm to the touch and as if electrified, a slight tingling sensation ran through his fingers. The Major took it out and twirled it in front of his eyes. It looked like a Christmas tree, not an artifact. But if not it, then what helped it survive the sandblasting?
Brazhnikov caught the doctor's gaze with his side-eye.
- What?
- Nothing. - The medic nodded at the artifact. - Valuable, if scientists are right. The injured man could use it.
- Do you believe this artifact is... all-powerful?
- I don't know, they're still few and unexplored, but there's smoke without fire. You, for example, got out without a scratch. It's no accident, is it?
- Not by chance. - Brazhnikov carefully placed the artifact on the stretcher, next to the victim's head.
- Better here, so it doesn't roll off. - The doctor carefully slipped the thing under the wounded man's arm. - Now we will surely get him there. And anyway.
- Do you believe in the power of artifacts, doctor? - The major glanced at the medic sideways. - Medicine is a science, and the Zone, mutants, anomalies, artifacts are almost mystic... how do they combine?
- Mysticism is everything we can't understand. - The Doctor shrugged again. - To me, for example, mathematics is pure mysticism. Isn't it science now? It's the same with Zona and her groceries... I'll tell the team that the Joker's all yours. When the boy recovers, the doctors will bring him back to you.
- Not mine, his. But you tell them on command. Just to make sure someone doesn't steal it... mystically.
- They might. - The doctor nodded. - In the Dymer they can.
- Stand down the Dymer. - The major shook his head negatively. - We'll take him to the hospital.
- Patient's a civilian," the medic hesitated, "he's not supposed to.
- That is an order," said Brazhnikov firmly. - I shall arrange it with the hospital authorities. And, doctor... you must take three lads and organize round-the-clock guard.
- At the hospital? There's plenty of security there.
- I understand that you're only formally a military man, captain Fomin, - Brazhnikov indulgently patted the medic on the shoulder, - but... if you discuss orders, I'll beat you up, got it?
- I see... that is so exactly. - Fomin dolefully sighed. - Artifact guard or a sick man?
- Both. You said he can't do it without the Joker. But the sick one first of all. I don't like this oil painting, Fomin. I don't like it.
Brazhnikov, as if emphasizing that his fears are serious, looked through the porthole.
- What I don't understand, why we don't take off?
The major silently asked the question and the pilots did not answer it, but the answer in the form of a small rocket fired from a man-portable air defence system arrived from the nearest woodland. Brazhnikov and Fomin were lucky in that the missile was destined for another aircraft. Further events broke the tether and galloped away. The Major jerked away from the glass and grabbed Fomin by the sleeve.
- Hold on!
The helicopter was jolted violently in the same instant. The doctor did not have time to grab on to something like a railing and fell on the wounded. Brazhnikov, meanwhile, jumped to the door and pushed it aside.
- Jump!
Fomin was certainly "paramilitary", but in critical situations he was no slower than a commando. He grabbed the stretcher with the wounded man and sharply turned it over. It worked rather well. The major, who jumped to the ground, caught the wounded man who had fallen out of the stretcher and rolled onto his back. The patient turned out to be quite weighty. The doctor threw out the stretcher and jumped out too. The second missile was not long in coming and hit the tail of the ambulance chopper. The car, for some unknown reason, roared with its hitherto "silent" engines and started burying its nose in the ground, simultaneously turning around its vertical axis in a clockwise direction. For a moment Brazhnikov imagined how the heavy grey side of the helicopter was crushing the hesitating people, but the picture did not linger in his imagination. There was no time for fantasies. The major grabbed the wounded man by the shoulders and dragged him away from the ground, rumbling and scratching the chopper. Fomin, too, quickly left the danger zone and not empty-handed, he dragged the stretcher.
- Jump! - turning around, shouted to the pilots.
The helicopter pilots were about to get out of the dying airplane without any command, but at that moment the engines were hit by another rocket and the helicopter abruptly went down and started to fall to pieces. The blast wave slightly lifted and then crushed the three survivors firmly to the ground. Brazhnikov remained conscious, and did not lose control at all for a moment, but he snapped his teeth with all his might, also not pleasant. The wounded man, however, was the hardest hit. The "Joker" was still with him, his pulse seemingly palpable, but it was unlikely that the new blow did the poor man any good. Fomin did not get off as easily as Major, fragment of some part of the helicopter snagged his shoulder, but the doctor was fit and even sober, without panic.
- We have to go to the depot, we will be lost in the field!
- Agreed. - Brazhnikov pointed to the woods. - It means we were shot from there, so we must go to the other side. We need to go down to the water. We get up there, put the wounded on a stretcher and walk along the bank. We enter the warehouse through the gate on the pier. The main ones are blocked by an anomaly.
- Roger that. Crawl?
- Exactly. - Brazhnikov glanced at the burning wreckage of the helicopters and grunted unhappily. - Born to crawl doesn't fly... much. Grab my right shoulder, I'll grab my left. Come on...</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_b4_doc_9">
	<text>It would seem that night is a time of complete silence and undisturbed peace. Night is full of sounds: sound of raindrops, footsteps, rustles, wind howls, indistinct echoes of someone's moans, and it is full of life, though not always normal. And it is also full of fear, heavy smells and moisture.
Especially dampness. At the end of October, the nights here are extremely wet. Dampness hangs in the air in drips of rain, forms a thin film of oily condensation on clothes and drips down your face, mingles with your sweat and leaves a salty taste on your lips.
It is terribly tiring and doubly dangerous to walk through this wet mess on an autumn night. It would be more reasonable to climb into the cab of a rusty truck, abandoned many years ago, or into some ruins and settle down for the night, but here, in the Zone, there is a logic of life.
Tired eyes close by themselves, wet palms slip from wet rifle buttstock, and feet parted in slippery mud, but frightening sounds, smells and shadows in grey night darkness do not allow stopping to rest and wait until rain ends or at least when dawn comes. They are as urgent as a long whip, they make you count new steps and kilometres, advancing stubbornly towards your goal or walking in a circle, it all depends on tactics and personal preferences of a stalker. But common to all the miners' tactics was and still is one rule: always keep moving. Only those who constantly move, have a more or less decent chance of returning. And given that most of the people come here for business and not for fun, constant movement becomes even more profitable.
Still, one cannot go forever. Ordinary raid in the Zone, of course, takes less time than an eternity, but even a week - from Vyborz to Vyborz - to hold on his feet unreal. Stops are necessary, no matter how frightening stops in the dank night, no matter how it seemed that the only moment to sit down and relax, immediately become prey hungry prowling everywhere mutants or a victim of the competition. And a fire to dry clothes and outfit is also a must. Here, you have to choose between health and fear.
However, for experienced stalkers a choice is obvious. Think mutants! And competitors would rather avoid them, or sit near the fire, offer to buy or sell some things, exchange found artifacts, or simply tell them the news from the "Great Land". Night fire in the Zone is a kind of truce territory. Happened, especially cold winter nights at the bonfire quite peacefully coexisted even warriors rival factions, not that ordinary stalkers, who generally quarrel with each other because of nothing. There was no enmity between them. Healthy competition, that's all.
Not always, of course, it turns out, but this is only because there are many scum roaming the Zone, who spit on all the laws and traditions, but also a lot of shifty or simply iz-motaniya endless test of strength desperate people. But most stalkers still observe the unwritten rules. For example, do not walk alone, do not mess with factions, do not put artifacts in the backpack, and carry in several waist pouches, not to take as trophies personal tokens and take the zone "passa-fats" only for a particular purpose. The Zone doesn't like those who come here for a tour or a "safari", that's a fact. They get it in the neck. At the same time, the guides get their asses kicked.
There are also some rules about the fire. And it seems that they are approved by the Zone. Whoever breaks them doesn't live long. It might be just a superstition, but no one dares to check the truthfulness of the omen on themselves.
- Even rats avoid the fires. It would seem creatures, and besides mutants, but smell that the Zone has a special opinion on this - said it, one of the stalkers sitting at the fire razed the coals and put on top of them opened tin of canned meat.
- I don't believe in omens," the other said, lazily adjusting the hood of his rubberized cloak. - In fact, I don't give a damn about superstitions. I just do what my common sense dictates, that's all. Works every time. Is that the Zone's fault, too?
- It's not the Zone's fault. It's not your fault you were born so stubborn.
The first one stared into the total darkness beyond the border of the spotlight for a moment, then began blowing on the embers, barely smouldering in the drizzling rain. The other man pushed his hood up again and fidgeted to make himself comfortable.
- I see you don't understand me, Phil. We've been walking together for a long time, and you still haven't grasped my attitude to life. You're always clogging your brains with some obscure theory. You're trying to find a common language with the Zone, like some egghead. That's why you can't get your hands on artifacts. That's not what you're thinking about.
- It's not about theories. - Phil blinked rapidly and rubbed his eyes with his fist. - And it's not about a common language with the Zone. I just want to know if there's room for humans in it, isn't there?
- That's right. No time for business. Mark my words, you'll get nothing but hemorrhoids from your thinking. You won't be making any money, that's for sure. Take it from me! I live easily and in perfect harmony with my body. If I want to sleep, I sleep, if I want to drink, I drink, and I don't bother with nonsense.
- Come on, Motya, I've been infiltrated by your philosophy for a long time. Lately I don't think about anything, but the stuff's still floating by. I guess it's not my thing. I'm trying for nothing. I'm not much of a stalker.
- But you write smoothly, and you've got all sorts of ideas in your head. You could start a business in the borderlands. You know, like a paid course for aspiring stalkers.
- Who needs them, these courses? All are clever nowadays, everyone knows where artifacts are taken and how much they cost. And how many beginners according to statistics do not come back from the first raid, for no one does not matter. Hunting is more than wilful. Plus cursed greed. The gold fever, epidemic broke out, there is no other word for it.
- It is yes, the Zone stirred up people, it straightened out many of them. But not everybody's greedy enough to come here. Take Monolith or Liberty. Did those crazy people come here for the money? Their ideas brought them here. And Duty? Everything they gather, they take to the scientists. They lose so much money! Idealists, too. What's greed got to do with it?
- It has nothing to do with greed," said Phil, shrugging his shoulders and tossing a couple of wet twigs into the fire. - But that's another option, clinical. Things aren't like people in the Zone.
Smoke from branches was more than heat, but rain for the last two days did not stop for a minute, and to find dry deadwood nobody could. Unless it was in the woods, between the boars' haunches. But it was more realistic to find deadwood there than decent wood.
- Deep thought," his partner grinned. - I'm not of average intelligence and can't dive. I can tell you're an ex-philosopher.
- There are a lot of military men too, - Phil thoughtfully continued the theme. - And there are a lot of scientists, too. No, you've gone too far with the gold rush. All in all, there's less than half the miners in the Zone. The rest make money differently, or not at all.
- All right, I agree, - Motya turned lazily from side to side. - What about the stew, warmed up?
- You should take the "soul" off a belt, - Phil jealously glanced at a pouch of comrade, - And all you have to gnaw and gnaw. You'll burst.
- I ain't got all to eat," his partner yawned. - I'll have a small one and go to sleep. Don't be jealous. I asked for you, you said no.
- I never mess with Carousel. I'm not afraid of anything, I can even get close to the Funnel... well, almost... but this one... I see it and my heart goes out. Maybe I have a premonition.
- My death? I don't think so. Unless, of course, you slowly turn into a midget, - Motya laughed shortly. - They can sense everything. Specialists said that some of them arrange ambushes in a week. The buggers see everything and are not afraid of anybody. Except for blind dogs, and that's when they attack in packs. How are the X-rays coming along?
He yawned again and shivered. It was the chill of autumn, or the mention of creepy blinded dwarfs from the dungeons of Chernobyl and Pripyat.
- Half a bottle left, if that's what you're implying. It is not enough for fun, it will only make you sleepy, but it will help against radiation. But for such purposes it should be consumed a little at a time, evenly.
- So let's... ...and let's kill it evenly and let it go to sleep, we were going to doze off for half an hour anyway.
- No. It's still 24 hours till ejection. There's plenty to go around.
- I'm already pretty well stocked. I could do with a little flapjack.
- You're not a sensitive man, Motya. You're all right, aren't you? If a wild boar bites you, you'll crawl out like you know how. You don't want to help me, and I won't help you.
- Soul will help," Motya patted his pouch lazily. - You know how wounds heal in front of your eyes with it.
- And cotton legs, - Phil grinned crookedly. - You can get away from a wild boar on your feet, you ain't got much to shoot with. You ain't got nothin', and you ain't got nothin'. How many cartridges left? A dozen?
- One and a half. And, by the way, all with explosive, - the partner stretched and yawned. - Very rare, handiwork, you might say. Got it off a dead man. Looks like he was a mercenary.
- A mercenary with a AK? - Phil hesitated.
- Why? You think they all walk around with advanced guns? "Kalash, by the way, if seven or sixty-two, and with special ammunition, is the most universal machine.
- A haymaker," Phil snorted. - Ain't no accuracy, especially with your shortened one. And shots, homemade or factory-made, are crap, every tenth one misfires.
- Yes, we can't hold our own against your Italy! - Motya snorted angrily. - Anyway, Phil, don't make it worse. I'll help you, all right. In the morning. All right? Let me take a nap now, since you're not pouring.
Motya stuck his hand behind his collar and scratched the rubbed shoulder with the strap of his backpack. Phil wanted to say something to his partner, but suddenly stood up sharply and reached for his weapon. Motya, too, became alert and froze in an absurd pose, his hand behind his collar. Both slowly turned in roughly the same direction and stared into the darkness. They couldn't see anything, but they didn't need to. The stalkers listened.
From the south-west, roughly from the direction of Staraya Krasnitsa or Buryakovka, a wave of new sounds, uncharacteristic of a rainy night, was rolling in. Rustling and murmuring were replaced by distinct clattering and growling; murmur of rain and rustling of leaves were drowned in indistinct muttering and sniffing, made by people, but also not animals.
Motya free a wet limb from under the hood, stood up, dug into his backpack and pulled out a military night vision device. Almost extinguished fire did not interfere with its work, and the stalker perfectly saw the source of cacophony, which violated the standard night "soundtrack". Dozens, maybe hundreds, of creatures walked by the frozen miners as they circled the quenching bonfire and headed in a straight line. Among them was a lot of people (or they were zombies, but at least bipedal), although the main mass of the living wave moving somewhere toward the centre of the zone were all sorts of mutants.
The sight was eerie and incomprehensible to even the experienced walker in the Zone, and there were two reasons for this. First, be bewitched creatures seemed mesmerized, looking strictly forward and not paying attention even to the sworn enemy, za¬tentimes breeding near, at a distance of one jump.
For example, a snorkel on four limbs literally a meter from the fire, which, contrary to his usual behavior, did not sniff the ground and did not jump as if a cat was electrocuted. Moitya somehow zipped the strap of the noctoscope, securing the device to his head, and picked up his favorite (albeit badly "used") "AKSU", preparing for a fight, but the mutant did not even move his ear, as if the stalker did not exist. Exactly the same, that is, nothing, reacted to bewildered miners followed almost on the heels of snark wild boar, and a little to the left rutted a whole pack of blind dogs - creatures usually very aggressive, but now some whimpering and whining like newborn puppies.
This was out of the ordinary, but the second thing was even stranger. None of the migrating creatures did not even try to avoid anomalies, as if by order, many settled on invisible "migration path. Motya perfectly saw how some blind dogs, usually feeling any traps, were tightened in the "vortex", and terrible pseudo-giant walking on unsteady legs was unwrapped and torn into small pieces by "carousel".
Completely perplexed Motya turned to his comrade and found that he also put on "night glasses", but is not looking in the direction of the border zone, and after wandering mutants.
- Do you understand anything? - his partner asked hoarsely, feeling Mothan's gaze.
- ß... well, I... No," Motya admitted. - But actually... The ejection is coming. It's like clockwork now, once a week. Maybe that's the point, to go to the dens.
- Then they'd be on their way to the periphery," Phil shook his head. - Maybe they'd go to Old Shepelice, or maybe they'd go to Kosarovka, or straight to Pripyat.
- Maybe it's the Call? - My partner suggested a new version. - Remember, they spoke at the base? I do not remember who... I think, Ryaboy. Well, that a new anomaly has appeared. A call. Who calls and why - no one knows, but even the controllers lose will and step on this damn call, like those rats on a pipe.
- That was Ryabo's own idea," said Phil in a low voice, turning to Mote at last. - And Palych has told that the Call is made by very powerful controller. He infiltrated Pripyat, settled in the "Energetic" and sounded the "general meeting". And the Zone amplifies this call. Or, maybe, controllers have learned to fog our minds with the "chorus" and...
Phil hesitated, stopping his phrase, and stared into the darkness again.
- To us? - Motya shook his head in a negative way. - The call isn't just for humans. Look, even the rats and wolves are trying to follow it. I think it's the call of the Monolith.
- Cult nonsense," muttered Phil, squatting down and fumbling for his rucksack. - The monoliths would chalk anything up to their own bricks. Any phenomenon in any part of the globe.
- What on Earth? - Motya took off his glasses and wiped sweat from his forehead.
- The sphere, - repeated his partner almost without intonation.
- Ah," he felt himself numb, as after a large dose of tranquilizer. He shook his head, trying to shake off the illusion, but the numbness did not disappear. - I don't feel so good, Phil. Maybe we should get out of here before it's too late.
- Though the sectarians might be right, and the monolith really does have special properties," he muttered to himself. - Or maybe it's the Zone itself... calling. Either way, the important thing is that those who went to the Call do not come back. Yes, Motya, let's go away from here, while it is not late. Life for a stalker is movement... or vice versa... doesn't matter. Let's go.
He threw his rucksack on his shoulder, put his shotgun on the bend of his elbow, and stepped resolutely against the movement of the strange wave of migrants. He stepped only once. Then abruptly turned round and staggered off together with the rest. Motya opened his mouth to shout at his companion, but could not let out a sound, a lump rising up in his throat as if from spite or irrational fear. In the next second it was as if an electric shock ran through his body, stalker shook thoroughly, and his feet carried him along with his partner.
- Stop, Phil! - Finally managed to cope with nervous spasm Motya. - We can not go there, we'll be lost!
- If the river will not get sucked into it, we'll get out, - his comrade grumbled without turning round.
- Wait! - Motya grabbed his friend by the sleeve. - Follow me! I'm not so plush, I have a full set of artifacts on my belt! "Sea urchins" as much as two pieces. It'll protect us both if we're close by. The Zov, too... probably. Two of us can make it!
- It's a waste of time, Motya," said Phil, glancing up at his friend, smiling his lips parted from his eyes. It was worse than a zombie grin. - We're screwed. Fact.
- We're not in trouble! - Motya glanced around in a vain attempt to find some sort of anchor, something capable of dispelling the obsession and giving his partners the strength to overpower the Call. He found nothing at first, but after a few seconds his gaze stumbled upon a figure in a dark robe, striding confidently "against the current."
The unknown man walked about fifty meters away from the stalkers, and now they could see only his back, but that did not prevent them from seeing how seriously equipped the unconquerable Call walker was. Behind a man in a long coat hung a knapsack of an old American flamethrower, not as powerful as the Soviet "LPO-50", but not so heavy and more economical. Its ammunition was seven one and a half litre rounds, against three, three litres and a half, of "LPO-50". Flamethrower clutched a pair of "silent" gun, which alternately launched when stalled mutants do not want to give way to him.
- There," Motya said, forcing his friend to turn around. - A man is walking on his own path and there's nothing wrong with it. And we will go! Cheer up, Phil!
- I can't, - Phil dropped his hands helplessly and stared at the ground. - I can't.
- He gripped his chin and made him look again in the wake of the man going his way, -We must go there, to Rechitsa, not to the centre. That way!
In the meantime the stranger approached the truck, a hundred meters away from the extinguished fire of the stalkers, and stopped, evidently intending to "smoke" his flamethrower.
- We follow him, like an ice breaker, will pass! - Motya whispered. - You just try, Phil!
- No, let go! - The partner tried to pull away, but Motya held firmly.
- Do you see? - Motya wanted to make an example of the man with the flamethrower again, but stopped himself.
The night darkness was torn by a lingering horizontal bolt of lightning. The fiery jet filled the remains of the truck's cabin with infernal flames, in which squirming human silhouettes could be seen. The stranger stopped shooting, bent down, and picked up some equipment from the ground. It was difficult to tell what it was from far away, but it looked like an artifact bag to Mota. And full of them.
In principle, this barbaric massacre in the Zone looked almost normal. Flamethrower killed several stalkers, or maybe bandits, and took their loot. In the Zone, such behavior was the order of the day. But as soon as Motya decided so, the situation changed abruptly. The stranger tied all the pouches in a single knot and threw them into the burning cabin. One could not doubt that trophies would burn to the ground.
Mota did not want to make an example of him and to call him a "rescue ice-breaker". Crazy - worse than mutants, it is better not to mess with them, this is one of the main laws of the Zone. Stalker let go comrade and sighed heavily. There was nowhere to retreat, and resist the Call was almost no more forces. The remnants of will rapidly fading away, despite the support and protection of artifacts.
- What was he doing... barbarian... - Motya stared in glazed eyes at the silhouette of the stranger, wavering in the glow of the chain of small fires, formed after the fire "show". - Such money...loses.
- Stalkers lose," the comrade added with noticeable delay. - And not for the first day. I know who that fireman is. It's Smoker. After Strelok, he's the most dodgy bloke in the Zone. The dealers put a good price on his hide.
- Well, go, try to get this skin, - moodily said Motya. - You'll lose yours at once. Have you seen his lighter?
- I could do it, but... - Phil shook his head. - I can't. Can't. That... The call. It's pulling. Come on, or I'm gonna be sick to my stomach.
- I'm getting a little queasy, too," my partner said. - Damn it, Phil, we're dead if we keep walking!
- I know," his partner said as indifferently as a robot. - I don't care. I'm going.
- And this... Smoker... doesn't care," Motya sighed. - Lucky crazy people.
- Whatever. - Phil stumbled on level ground, fell to one knee, stood up, using expensive Italian SPAS-12 shotgun, as an ordinary crutch, and wandered back in the direction of the distant ruins of Novo-Shepelic, north-western edge of the dead city of Pripyat - the centre of the Zone.
- It may not matter, but I will go first," said Mo-tya, taking off his rucksack, walked three paces in front of his comrade.
- It's all pointless," Phil whispered faintly. - Who goes first does not matter. Neither the Call nor death could be fooled.
After walking a hundred yards, he unhooked and dropped the pouch with the meager haul of artifacts, dropped the backpack, and then, with absolutely no regret, dropped the rifle as well.
A sonorous, borderline perceptive call was both terrifying and beckoning. The combination of unconscious horror and misplaced elation, akin to the euphoria of a premonition of great fortune, created a sense of unreality of what was happening. It could not be, but it was. Remnants of sanity tried to sober the prospector who was losing control over himself, but all was in vain.
With each step, with each meter that brought Phil closer to the ruins of the city, the mysterious Call grew more insistent and, it seemed, more voluminous. It filled not only the space around, but also penetrated into every cell of his body, affecting every nerve, every neuron, so that his movements became stiff and uncertain, like those of a zombie, and will and mind finally dissolved into eerie but melodious sea of low sound. Prospector walked, no longer thinking of the deadly danger ahead, experiencing no feelings at all except for the heavy slab of fear and the deadly desire to get as fast as possible to the unknown source of the Call. Nothing could stand in the way of that yearning. Not even Phil's long-standing fear of the Carousel, which circled monotonously in the pre-dawn twilight.
Phil panicked for a moment, but a cursed indifference ruthlessly trampled the panic that was salvageable in this case, and the Call continued to pull forward, straight into the deadly anomaly.
Phil glanced wistfully at the slouching back of his partner, walking ahead and slightly to the right. Motin route was literally three meters from the line, a step beyond which a man risked instant death. An invisible but powerful whirlwind spun and tore the victims apart, scattering only small fragments of unfortunates around. If Motya took a little to the left, he would not have had to worry about the damned Call. But his partner walked where he walked. In addition, he had more than one valuable artifact in his pouch. There was there, except for "Hedgehogs" and "Soul," and "Night Star", seriously weakening the gravity of anomalies like this very "carousel. So now Phil had not to worry about that, but about himself. His route was the right one. That is, on the contrary, where it should not, exactly through the centre of the vortex.
Phil tried to stop, but his body did not obey. His legs stubbornly carried him towards death. The very one that he had foreseen, like an ugly mutant "midget", from the very beginning, from his first trip to the Zone.
The Prospector made a fist of will, clenched his teeth and tried to change the route, to take at least some meters to the right, but the will turned into imaginary water, trickled down and Phil continued his way straight ahead.
Very soon the somber melody of the Call sounded to Phil in a new way. It was now clearly a variation on a funeral march. But that didn't bother the stalker. Everything that was happening seemed like a dream to him.
Only a few steps were left to the Carousel, when the walker woke up the last time, involuntarily closed his eyes and tried to scream, but the horror clutched his throat, and Phil barely audible hissed...
...Motya failed to understand what caused him to wake up from the acid-like dissolving melody of the Call. Whether it was a hoarse groan or a distinctive feeling of distress. Having walked about a dozen paces, he turned around and looked around the place with indifferent glance. There was no Phil behind him. There was only twilight, shadows of mutants walking in parallel courses, enchanted by the Zov and almost beside, behind and slightly to the left, a barely perceptible whirlwind of dust, marking the "Carousel.
"The hunch, unfortunately, was right. - Motya shook some bloody sludge off his shoulder. - Pity about Phil. Probably the best option, though. After all, there's no telling what awaits me there at the source of the Call. Maybe something ten times worse! And Carousel is quick and painless. One click and it's done. Easy death."
He looked ahead again and involuntarily lifted his eyes above the horizon, to the grey morning sky. For a few seconds there was a small gap in the leaden cloud, and the stalker saw a piece of blue sky with a reddish dawn edge.
"The last dawn," the stalker lowered his gaze to the ground. - The morning of the last day. Was it worth it? Probably, it was worth it. And if not - it is late to guess now. The call will explain everything... he'll tell me everything... and then he'll kill me. And he'll be right."</text>

	<text>Olga was awakened by a long sound, as if someone sighed heavily on the floor above. The girl opened her eyes wide and stared into the darkness. She lay there listening for a few minutes, but heard nothing more. However, the sound was not a dream, of that Olga was sure. She was dreaming of entirely different sounds. Mostly it was the screaming, growling, and cracking of machine guns. Every night for several years now. And no matter how many times during the night Olga woke up, each new dive into sleep would start the eternal "reel" over again. Even if Olga did not remember her dream in the morning, she could swear on a polygraph - it was the same dream she always had. In the first six months, waking up after another nightmare, Olga cried and even threw a fit of silent hysteria, but then she got used to it, and a year later she stopped paying attention to dreams at all. Or rather, the dream. It was the same dream every night. One gets used to everything. Especially a person who has passed the test of the Zone.
Olga closed her eyes and almost immediately found herself back in that weatherful April day...

...Behind the sightseeing bus window, spring landscapes, some buildings and road junctions flashed by. The people in the bus were slightly excited, Olga could hear the steady hum of conversation and laughter. 
A road sign suddenly caught Olga's eye. "CHORNOBILE." Against the background of the outwardly normal, blooming spring nature and the piercingly blue sky, the signpost with the ominous inscription did not look scary at all. Normal. Harmless. 
The bus pulled into the car park in front of the institute, where all excursions to the Exclusion Zone began. Tourists had been warned about this back in Kiev, but still someone asked the boy guide: "Where have we arrived?" The guide, his name was Sasha, answered all questions patiently and kindly. The guy, by the way, was handsome. However, Olga was fifteen at the time, and all guys from seventeen to twenty caused her extreme sympathy. 
Sasha got off the bus and suggested that the tourists also get out into the fresh air. Some, as they left the cabin, began to look around cautiously, like her mother, some looked around curiously - that was Olga, and her father, for example, was not looking around, he was staring with bated sadness at the sign to the right of the entrance. It was an institution he had once worked in when he had just graduated from university. 
In fact, that was why, when Olga suggested he go on an excursion to the Zone, he did not wag his finger at his temple, as his mother had done, but agreed. He paused for the sake of formality, but he agreed. Olga suspected that he had wanted to do this for a long time, but for some reason he could never decide to come to the place where he had once been happy. 
The motley crowd of tourists mingled with the other crowd that poured out of the bus, which arrived a minute later. The tardy bus was already the sixth and did not fit into the cramped car park. Excursions to the Exclusion Zone were popular, no doubt. 
The crowd around Olga cheered, oohed and aroused imported "wow" as they gazed at the generally unrepresentative picture. 
There was barely any life in the city: scientists, power engineers, and workers of small auxiliary enterprises like a canteen or a laundry were toiling sluggishly, but not a single local resident. Everyone came here from the Big Land and worked their way back. No one lived in Chernobyl permanently. So the town was despondent rather than enthusiastic. Despite the blue sky overhead and the sunshine that flooded the untended streets. 
It was as if the guide had read Olga's thoughts and smiled encouragingly at her. 
- Compared to Pripyat, this is still a living city. Well, you will see for yourself... What is your name? 
Olga's heart suddenly beat fast and her tongue went dry for a moment. 
- Olga. 
- It will be cool, Olga, I promise! 
Sasha smiled again and turned his attention to the other tourists. 
- Now all of you will pass instruction, will receive dosimeters and masks! Don't forget to buy spare batteries! 
- How long will we stay here? - Someone from the crowd asked. 
- In Chernobyl one hour. Then we go to the observation platform near the sarcophagus and further to Pripyat. Three hours there and then we come back here. We go through control, have lunch and go to Kiev. 
- And what dose of radiation will we get? 
- Minimal. - Sasha looked again at Olga and winked. - Do not worry, you are not first excursion in the Alienation Zone (he nodded at other buses). We have been taking people here for five years already, everything is worked out. 
He did not look at Olga any more, but she was not offended. A job is a job. There was no time to flirt. The main thing was that he paid attention to her himself! Not a curly, like a bologna, blonde with a bouffant shape and waistline, but an unsightly big-eyed teenage girl. And also constrained by the presence of her parents. Oh, cool! And not going to be, but already there! 
Olga looked at her parents. Her mother pressed against her father's shoulder and murmured something. Olga listened. 
- I feel uncomfortable here. 
- Relax," said her father calmly. - We had agreed not to panic! It's just a little adventure. Yes, Olga? 
Olga forced out a smile and answered with exaggerated cheerfulness: 
- Yes, Dad! Mum, relax! My classmates have all been here already. It'll be fine. 
- There you go. - Dad put his arm around mum's shoulders. - Out of the mouths of babes... 
- Dad!" Olga raised her eyebrows in indignation. 
The late bus backed up and pulled out onto the roadway. It drove forward and rolled across the small square, about to turn around. At that time, the tourists, smiling nonchalantly, staggered towards the entrance of the institute. 
And at that moment... everything around was flooded with the blinding white light of the brightest flash. 
Then the dream usually just switched to a new episode - dark and gloomy as opposed to the previous one, but sometimes a narrow terminator of crumpled memories did come between light and darkness. Olga saw the bus explode into the air, saw the monstrous force of the blast wave throw the heavy car at the monument in the centre of the square and rip it in two, as the building then collapsed and the heavy stone rain down on the crowd of tourists. In this part of the memory obscured by the mind was some other terrible and very important episode, but Olga could not remember it in her dreams or in reality. Every time she tried to do so, it was as if a fuse was tripped: the dream would abruptly return to the moment of flashback, and Olga was forced to settle for something like a glue. Immediately after the flash came a cold, frightening darkness. 
Olga sat on the prickly concrete rubble, hugging her knees and sobbing in quiet hysteria. She could feel the air moving - there was no roof over the ruins she had crammed herself into. She could smell the strong smell of burning, coughing up dust every now and then, but she was unable to move to find a place that wasn't so smoky and dusty. She could hear the crackling of burning logs, the unceasing rumbling, the lingering howling of the wind, and the distant echo of some eerie sound. It could have been a groaning or a growling or maybe a laughing sound. It was impossible to tell from afar. 
And then, at some point, a new sound came to Olga's ears. They were heavy footsteps. Several people were walking cautiously through the rubble. They exchanged a few words, in between hissing and hissing. 
The sound of footsteps grew louder. Then it subsided. Olga looked up. Standing in front of her was a man in military uniform, wearing a filter mask and holding a weapon in his hands. He shone a torch in Olga's face, and the girl squeezed her eyes shut. 
The man slowly approached, sat down and took off his mask. 
- Don't be afraid," he said softly. - It is all over now. You are all right now. Shall we go? 
He smelled of tobacco and sweat, but it did not annoy Olga, it pleased her. He was a living man! After the cold draught of eternity in the dead ruins, to meet a living man was a natural happiness, even more than happiness. Olga almost calmed down and leaned forward, in full readiness to get up and go with the soldier. The soldier also rose from his squatting position and extended his hand to Olga... 
And at that moment Olga saw something that she would never be able to forget, even if her nightmares ceased. From the half-light behind the soldier's back, a hideous monster, only vaguely human-like, emerged, biting into the fighter's neck with its sharp teeth and literally biting off his head in two passes. Olga screamed wildly and tried to crawl away, but it did her no good. Blood and warm chunks of human flesh flew into her face and she gasped for breath. 
Most of the time the dream ended there, but occasionally Olga would linger in the creepy "reel" a little longer. She dreamed that she was huddled up against a wall and squeezed her eyes shut in anticipation of imminent death. The monster made a loud clucking sound, devouring the remains of a soldier, and Olga was forced to listen to the disgusting clucking, and at the same time the lines that came from the headset that had come off the fighter's head. 
- Berkut, answer Topaz! Berkut! What's your situation, what's going on?! Any surviving civilians? 
- Topaz, this is Berkut, heavy smoke, I can't see a damn thing! There's some movement... 
- What movement, Berkut, talk sense! Are those civilians? Survivors? 
- Who can tell? Maybe they're survivors. They're behaving strangely. They don't come near us, they shy away, but they don't go far. Shit, it looks like they're surrounding us! 
- I don't follow you, Berkut. Do you see the enemy?! 
- No! Who the hell are those bastards?! Where the hell did they come from?! 
The airwaves were briefly replaced by the crackling of interference, growling, shouting in the distance, the noisy breathing of a running man, growling again, and gunshots. 
- They are everywhere! - Suddenly Berkut shrieked. - There are thousands of them! 
- I don't understand, Berkut, who thousands?! Is it the enemy or not? 
- These things are everywhere! - There was panic in Berkut's voice. - They are... ARE NOT PEOPLE! Take that, you bastards! Get the... 
The crackle of gunfire could be heard again, then the shouting stopped, replaced by wheezing and interference again. 
- Berkut! - Topaz shouted, breaking his voice. - What is happening?! 
There was no answer. The air was filled with shrieks, growling, and the same crackling noise. The only articulated sounds on the air were Topaz's shouts: 
- Hold on, Berkut! Help is coming! 
Gradually the shots were fewer and fewer, and the horrible howls and growls grew farther away... and at some point the sounds disappeared altogether. 
That was the end of even the longest sleep. Which was no surprise. In reality, by this point, Olga had lost consciousness... .</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_b5_doc_8">
	<text>Happiness is the same for all stalkers. If you make a trip to the Zone, having successfully avoided the traps, you are blissful. You didn't get caught in the teeth of a completely mad monster, and you're lucky again. Filled the container full of trinkets, for which the bagmen, who settled in the Zone, ready to fill your pockets tugrikov - happiness doubled. Well, if after that you got out of the Zone in one piece, with arms and legs, and a working brain - great happiness. The Zone doesn't accept everyone, and even more rarely lets them go.
   But everyone has his own unhappiness. Because the Zone is inventive with all sorts of nastiness and nastiness. And it has its own surprise for everyone. A special one. One that's not like the others. The Zone doesn't like to repeat itself. It'll scare one of them to death, but it'll let them go afterwards anyway. And the other will kill him where dozens or even hundreds have gone before, without even stumbling. And they'll walk by afterwards and marvel - what a waste of space...
   The stalker nicknamed Goupi knew what happiness meant. He went to the Zone for the fifth year, and so far has remained alive and well. But he didn't believe in luck. He knew many young men who firmly believed in their luck, whom the Zone had chewed up, swallowed, and not even spit out their bones. Goupi knew that if you wanted to stay alive in the Zone, you had to rely not on luck or fortune, but on an accurate knowledge of the area and the creatures that inhabited it. Most importantly, you have to trust only yourself. After all, for every man his own skin is his greatest value. He can swear eternal friendship and doggy loyalty, but when death closes in, he will forget all about it in a moment. He will have only one thought to guide his actions: I want to live! Oh, he wants to live! I want it so badly that I'll cut anyone's throat!
   With that in mind, Goupi always went to the Zone alone.
   Maybe that's why he was still alive.
   He never joined any of the veteran clans, although he did know some veteran friends, and frequently received offers, and never took along his "pickers", those novice stalkers, who could be let loose on the slippery slopes. Likewise, Goupi refused to work as a guide for extreme tourists who like to go into the Zone just to tickle their nerves. Even if the route was easy and the money was good. He did not take orders from the hustlers either. Simply went to the Zone immediately after the next, climbed in such a place where not everyone will not, filled a container full of turquoise, and returned, sold the goods to whoever it was. Gupi knew the price of his trinkets and did not like to bargain. If a traders refused to pay the right amount, in the stalker's opinion, he silently took the goods and went to another. After selling his trinkets, he disappeared for a month or two.
   Gupi was not known for drunkenness or debauchery. He wasn't in the habit of embezzling money. Didn't sit down to play, not even a small game. If he did frequent a bar frequented by stalkers, it was only for business, be it a gun or some ammunition, or a flash drive with a new map.
   ...Nobody knows where he came from. Few people remember how Goupi first walked into Rat's bar. He wore heavy boots, wide trousers and a worn peacoat, belted up with a star-spangled plaque. A baseball cap with a greasy visor and an incomprehensible inscription GSC. Behind his belt was a sawed-off Izhevsk 16-gauge shotgun. He was carrying a green-and-blue fiberglass duffel bag, the kind the old Chinese and Turkish shuttles used to carry their stuff in. Gupi silently walked through the hall, past the tables with stalkers staring at this marvel, stopped at the bar, put the bag on the floor, with a soulful look at the barman, and quietly inquired:
   - Who can be offered artifacts here?
   Upon hearing this, Rat - and at that moment the owner himself was behind the bar - only grinned contemptuously. What could such a diminutive beggar possibly bring? A lump of Rusty Hair? "Witches' Tears? A handful of unloaded dummies? But when Gupi put his duffel bag on the table and began unloading the trinkets, Rat's eyes widened. Soon, sensing that something unusual was going on, stalkers in the bar began to gather there. But Gupi, meanwhile, quietly, as if there was no one around, laid out in front of the bewildered Rat brought turds. First, the two Heavenly Apples hung over the counter, not touching it.
   - How did he manage to get them without a container? - One of the stalkers said in amazement.
   Then came three 'Sad Whistles' out of the bag, just stuffed in condoms so they wouldn't whistle in vain. Then two briquettes of Dum-mumijo, each the size of a brick. A handful of Mobius Rings, five Dumb Lighters, a dozen Shards of Heaven - a couple almost the size of a fist! - One Dragon's Eye, and a strange object, like a semi-abstract figure with flowing lines, resembling a brooding human sitting, as if cast from a material resembling stone, glass and metal at the same time. Only five such figures existed before the then unknown Goupi appeared in the bar. His was the sixth. Later he brought in three more. After passing through the many hands of dealers and intermediaries, one of the figurines was bought by the British Museum. A second was purchased by the Louvre. The rest ended up in private collections. It is not clear why these figurines became known as "korostelin gods". What's a corncrake got to do with it, though? No one could explain what they were in reality. The only thing scientists agreed on was that the Korosteel Gods were made of material that could not be obtained under terrestrial conditions. The figures were blackly stained, so they were hung under covers of thick, lead-lined glass. And it is understandable, because the "Korostelin gods" were found only behind the Rusty Wood, in the second radar zone, where not every experienced stalker can stray. Because if you were to get away from there in time, you would get under the psychotropic radiation, then this woodpecker would smash your head so badly that your brains would turn into fricassee. Getting there without an anomaly detector and special protective gear Goupi on his first trip was impossible. He must have found another place. But he kept quiet about it, no matter how many times he was questioned.
   But that was not all!
   In the end Gupi got a plastic lid closed three-liter jar, and in it - two homunculi!
   That was quite a mouthful.
   And Rat immediately went to get tugriks - just in case the newcomer hadn't offered his trinkets to someone else. And, I must say, he paid off Gupi fair and square. He gave most of it in tugriks and the rest in weapons and equipment.
   Though afterwards, after drinking a cup of coffee Gupi left the bar, Rat shook his head sympathetically.
   - Lucky bastard, but not for long. The Zone does not like the lucky ones.
   That time, not only Rat, but perhaps all who were in the bar, decided that the newcomer simply unspeakably lucky. It happens sometimes. A newcomer goes to the Zone, gets into a place where no one had ever been, drags expensive trinkets, gets drunk on joy, and drinks to his heart's content, but on the second go-around he vanishes without a trace. In addition, even appropriately dressed, Goupi bore little resemblance to a stalker. He was about six feet tall, but scrawny as a Stalinist convict, with shoulders that looked so weak it was a wonder his rucksack straps didn't fall off. Goupi's face was narrow - someone joked that he had only a profile - with a pointed chin, a long, hooked nose, slightly slanting, close-set eyes, and large ears, as if glued to his skull. To top it all off, a thin string of black mustaches on his lip. Not a stalker, a life, but a pimp of the Mediterranean. But Gupi had been to the Zone time and time again, and always came back in one piece. And the traders nearly turned on each other with knives for the trinkets he brought. Everyone knew that any such trinket, though expensive, will pay triple. That was the minimum.
   Goupi's habits were strange, too. Strange for a stalker. First, he didn't smoke. Second, he didn't drink alcohol. I mean, absolutely! Never took a drop in his mouth. Not even for company. Maybe that's why he didn't have company. Thirdly, he did not gamble and did not bet money on anything.
   He did, however, have a weakness of his own. Goupi could not live without coffee. And he wanted real, freshly brewed coffee, not the stale brew from a thermos and definitely not instant coffee powder. So wherever Goupi went, he carried a bag of ground coffee and an old tin coffee pot, which could be placed directly on the coals.
   Goupi had been warned more than once by Komar:
   - Cut the crap, old man! It won't do you any good! When you make your own coffee, the smell goes all over the Zone!
   - So what? - Goupi pretended he didn't know what he was talking about.
   - So it's a cinch to track you down with it, then!
   Goupi protested with a perplexed look on his lips.
   - When you smoke, it smells like tobacco, too.
   - That's tobacco. How many non-smokers have you seen? And you're the only one who makes coffee over a fire.
   - Bloodsucker don't care if it's coffee or tobacco. He smells it, he'll come at you.
   - Am I talking about bloodsuckers with you? - The Komar was grumbling indignantly.
   - Who am I talking about? - Gopey raised his eyebrows in surprise.
   - There's something worse than a bloodsucker in the Zone," Komar said, his voice lowering slightly. - It's called a man. Everybody around here knows you're as lucky to be with them as anybody else.
   - I'm not lucky, I just know how to look.
   - Who cares! Watch out, Goupi, you'll run into looters. Or some of them youngsters might get their hands on your stuff.
   - I'll be careful," Goopy promised Komar.
   And he was careful indeed. Damn careful.
   But he kept on making coffee.
   Either out of principle, or he really couldn't give it up.
   After all, a man without weakness isn't even a man. And the one Goupi had was not the worst...
   Standing up, Goupi removed the lid from the coffee pot and stirred the boiling coffee with a spoon. A pungent aroma wafted up from under the lid, overpowering the stench of the marsh stew with the metallic aftertaste that wafted from the lake.
   Somewhere in the distance a nocturnal bird rumbled. As if in response a Chernobyl dog howled long and sadly, as if in a gut-wrenching way.
   Gupi smiled happily, slid a thick goldfish glove over his hand and removed the pot from the fire. The safe in which he was going to spend the night was secure. Almost like the safe in which Rat kept his tugris. Having first discovered the place a couple of years ago, Goupi had been using it regularly ever since. The place was near Lake Amber, so well located that it was bypassed by the wave of psychotropic radiation, which washed over the lake shores whenever the radar was working under it. Psychotropic radar's a nasty thing. Nasty because it's incomprehensible. Blows your brains out like a lightning bolt. Goupi had seen people stomping on the roofs of flooded cars in the lake, to the very centre of it. Why? Who the hell knows! No one ever goes back. That is why even zombies try to avoid these places. Away from harm's way, they say. The cave Goupi once favored was probably the entrance to a system of military bunkers, passages between which are said to stretch beneath Amber. Something must have exploded in that bunker, so much so that the walls and ceiling collapsed. If you go deep into the bunker, after seven meters you will reach the rubble. It's a good rubble, it's solid. You don't have to worry about creatures crawling out of the ground. The same burers in the underground communications left by the military are teeming with them, breeding and multiplying in accordance with God's will. And there's a fire burning in front of the entrance to the cave. He could not see it from outside, Goupi checked, but if anyone tried to poke his way in, a silhouette would immediately flare up in front of the fire. And Goupi had an automatic rifle with an empty grip, so he could shoot at point-blank range and knock the bloodsucker out.
   The place was also convenient because it was near the village of eleven yards, of which there was not even a name. But after the artifacts in it was, as mushrooms in July after rain. True, anomalies were also popping up everywhere, like fly agarics. But that's what the Zone is, to show teeth. And that's what a stalker does, to bite out those teeth. Or avoid them, it was up to him. Gupi usually just happened to find himself near that lovely village just before the blowout. Waiting for the blowout in the hiding place, he was first in the berry place and well before the main group of artifact hunters approached to collect all the most expensive and interesting.
   What do you call that?
   Luck?
   No!
   A literate, skilled approach to business is what it is called!
   Luck has nothing to do with it.
   Once he had collected his trinkets, Goupi went to the scientists' camp at the other end of the lake. "The botanists not only paid well for rare trinkets, but also for the quite common ones, which they urgently needed for the experiments, so they could also get useful things, the same capsules and containers for artifacts, or a software update for the anomaly detector. Or even to learn something new about the theme, why the Zone krevshit so. In general, the "geeks" themselves do not really understand anything, but loved to smartly speculate about what ordinary people can never figure out. Even after a hundred grams.
   Gupi took a large enamel mug from his backpack, carefully wiped it with a clean handkerchief and only then poured the steaming coffee into it. He closed his eyes and gently sniffed the aroma from the mug with his nostrils. The smell of coffee was a very important part of the pleasure a true connoisseur gets from this majestic beverage. If coffee was odorless, it would probably be unpalatable.
   Goupi folded his lips into a tube and gently took a sip of the scalding hot beverage.
   It was heavenly!
   Gupi threw his head back. A blissful smile split his face from ear to ear.
   It was for that smile that one of the green stalkers, who had perished on his fourth go, called him Guinplen behind his eyes. He must have been one of the educated ones. Everyone liked the nickname, especially when the boy explained what it meant. But it was too long for everyday use. A stalker's nickname was supposed to be short, a one-breath nickname, easy to call out. Or one-shot, to put it down quickly. So that's how Guinplain became Goupi. However, the story is now relegated to the realm of stalker mythology, and most neophytes honestly believe that the nickname Goupi is rooted in the name of every aquarist novice fish.
   Let them think what they want! Goupi himself did not care. Lying sideways on an old tractor tyre, he leisurely sipped his excellent coffee and enjoyed it immensely.
   However, the coffee was not the only reason for the stalker's state of mind. Nearby there were two containers, one of which was loaded with a dozen and a half "singing springs" and two "Chains", about a meter long each. Actually, originally it was one "Chain", but while trying to push it into the container, Goupi carelessly hooked the "Chain" with a stick and it broke in two. Of course, one long Chain is better than two short ones. But there was nothing to be done about it, chains are like that, they break at a moment's notice. The second container held two Dragon Eyes and a medium-sized briquette of dum-mumijo. In the rucksack, wrapped neatly in a baize cloth, was a capsule of dead water. It had kept Gupi in the village longer than he had planned. He usually made it to the scientists' camp before dawn, where he spent the night in the small maintenance tent. But when he came across a bush whose leaves were strewn with droplets of dead water, like black dew, Goupi knew he couldn't leave such a wonderful find for anyone else. He took a long, painstaking, careful look at the automatic dispenser to collect the droplets of dead water. Three times Gupi was distracted from this activity, requiring absolute attention and full concentration, in order to rustle up the flesh rustling in the bushes. He had already had to take up the submachine gun in the late afternoon, when a zombie, a fairly fresh one with a huge bazooka on his shoulder, came charging at him. Judging by the weapons and uniforms, it was a soldier from the German corps of international military forces guarding the perimeter of the Zone. Fortunately, the ex-soldier had apparently forgotten how to use the weapon, which he still habitually carried with him. Gupi first broke his legs at the knees with a short burst from a submachine gun, and then cut off his head with a machete. All in all, it had been a quiet day. The outburst happened just before dawn, and the bulk of the creatures had not yet had time to get here from the centre of the Zone. Tomorrow, and especially the day after tomorrow, the stalkers who come to get what Gupi left behind, there will be something to shoot.
   The bazooka the German zombie was carrying was damaged. They were out of ammunition, too. But Goupi took it to his hiding place anyway. Who knows, maybe someday it would come in handy. He decided to spend the night in the hiding place. Not to sleep - you can't sleep! - just a little snooze. Early in the morning, on the dew, not barefoot, he could run to the camp of scientists, throw off some trinkets and sleep for a few hours. If you leave Yantar at about two o'clock, then you can get to "Stalker" bar by nightfall. Assuming, of course, nothing would happen on the way. And it could happen very easily. Anything could happen. This is the Zone, not Disneyland. And not even Alexei Peshkov's Park of Culture and Rest.
   "Nerds" was for what was in the first container - "Singing Springs" and "Chain" split in two. "Dragon Eyes and Dum-mumii Gupi was going to give to Draga, a serious merchant who does not take everything, but only what goes up in value tenfold beyond the gates of the Zone. "Dragon Eyes" were popular with mystics, occultists, spiritualists, and psychics, who considered this artifact a vastly improved version of the classic crystal ball. And the dum-mumie was prized for supposedly being able to cure any disease, including Peruvian trench fever, which a year and a half ago struck the entire civilised world with fear and trembling, as AIDS once did. The "nerds" from Yantar did not say anything about these two pellets. Although they took them willingly. But they paid considerably less than Draghi. So they rarely got anything. And Gupi thought that if only Dragon's Eye could predict the future and Dum-mumiyo could cure any ailment, then stalkers would be the happiest, healthiest and most informed men in the world.
   Gupi grinned and took a large sip from his coffee mug.
   - Hey, stalker! - There was a long groan from across the lake. - Stalker! Brother! Help!
   What a mess! Goupi almost swore. The dead stalker began his song again! So now he would walk about half the night, howling and moaning like the shadow of Hamlet's father, until he himself perished in the lake.
   - Stalker!... Hurry up, Stalker!.. I can't take it anymore!... Help, brother!
   How nasty people can be! Not only are they dying, but they want to drag others down with them!.. You foul-mouthed wretches!
   Gupi spat contemptuously to the side and gulped down the remainder of his coffee.
   He set the empty mug down on a small flat rock, then reached for the coffee pot by the fire to refill it. The moment he took hold of the hot metal handle, a shadow flashed through the open doorway of the cache. Before Goupi could even make out who it was, a dense, resilient blow to the chest threw him back against the wall. Fortunately he did not fall far. Falling sideways, Goupi reached for the machine gun.
   There was a hiss of coffee spilled into the fireplace. The lights faded, and a stifling aroma floated beneath the vaults of the cache.
   Goupi switched on his hand torch.
   The beam of light flickered on the stones at the entrance, and caught on something grey and shapeless, which was not there before.
   Without thinking long, Goupi pulled the trigger.
   A short, dry shot broke the silence of the night.
   The burrower, hiding among the rocks, sprang to his feet, and with short, crooked arms and outstretched fingers, sprang at the stalker, playfully and fearfully throwing himself over his head.
   Despite their amusing appearance, telekinetic dwarves were among the most dangerous creatures of the Zone. Mainly because, unlike other creatures, they were intelligent. But their minds were of a different order than humans - as the "nerds" said of the Burer - perverted to the extreme, so much so that one never knew what was in a Burer's mind.
   The Burer, who had entered the cave, spread his arms out to his sides, trying to pick up the broken concrete beam in front of him. Normally they do such tricks easily, but this one was unable to get a grip on it. The concrete block fell to the ground again, barely lifted. With a grudging squeal the burer thrust his spread fingers at the stalker. Goupi felt himself pressed against the wall. But, not badly. He could even get up and walk towards the burer if he wanted to. But why would he do that when the stalker had a machine gun in his hands.
   Goupi took careful aim, squeezed the trigger, and didn't release it until the dry click of the bolt let him know that the clip was out of ammunition. Quickly snapping the empty chamber off, Goupi slid a new one into place, got to his feet, and cautiously, holding the sight of the old rag-like burer's motionless body, approached him.
   Unlike bloodsuckers, they were not known for their survivability. Gupi poked the little bugger gingerly in the side with the toe of his boot. The dwarf moaned softly. His thumbs closed into a clenched fist.
   What a number! The Burer was still alive!
   Actually, the most sensible thing to do in this situation would have been to finish him off and throw him into the lake. But suddenly Goupi wondered what was going on. He had the misfortune to want so badly that he couldn't bear it. Like when you can't reach the itchy spot.
   There was indeed something strange going on. Or should I say unusual. For one thing, the Burer had never set foot in Goupi's hiding place before. They had never set foot on the beach, though they had been cowering in the old army bunkers somewhere in the vicinity. He was acting strange, too, that half-dead burer. What the hell was he doing in the light? Like he had nowhere else to hide. Maybe he's sick. Even his first kinetic blow knocked Goupi off his feet only by virtue of surprise. Then the dwarf couldn't even lift a stone.
   Hooking the toe of his foot, Goupi flipped the burer's body onto its back.
   The ugly dwarf stared at him with wide eyes. His lips moved as if he was trying and failing to say something, only the blood in the corners of his mouth was bubbling. A bullet hole the diameter of a finger was gaping in his left temple, surrounded by a crust of dried blood.
   So he'd been shot before I had, Goopy realized. Or maybe he'd gone into the cave to hide. Or...
   Burer wrapped both arms around himself, his left arm under his tattered cloak. Like he was trying to hide something.
   That's right! Goupi figured it out. The Burerer went into the hiding place to hide something. Nobody knows about this place but Goupi, and most of the time it's empty. It's a good place to hide, all right. But what's a burer got to hide?
   And who's been hunting him?
   Goupi squatted down beside the dying burer, put the machine gun in his lap, and stretched the wound on his head with two fingers. Three hours, tops, had passed since the bullet had struck the burer in the forehead. How far can a badly wounded bruiser get? That's it - his stalker's out there somewhere...
   That's ridiculous!
   Who would chase a mortally wounded burer through the Zone?
   - Show us what you've got, will you? - Gupi tried to pull his left arm away from the Burer, but he was still trying to resist.
   But he was still trying to resist.
   Goupi raised his submachine gun and struck the burer briefly, almost without a swing, with the butt of his rifle in the shot temple.
   The dwarf twitched with his whole body, then fell silent.
   Maybe he was dead at last.
   Goupi spread his arms to his sides, drew his knife, and gingerly twisted his clothes. Though they weren't bloody clothes, only rags, old and tattered, worn out to the point of being useless. He had as much rags on him as leaves on a cabbage. He also grew more and more foul-smelling with each layer he put on.
   Goupi was beginning to think that enough was enough, that stinker could go to hell, with all his foul-smelling secrets. He had to grab his legs and drag him out of the hiding place. Suddenly the point of the knife hit something hard.
   - Brother!... - the dead stalker again sang his dull song in the darkness. - Save me, stalker brother! I'm lost!...
   - Yeah, I'll be right there," Goupi muttered under his breath, frustrated.
   Goupi snatched up another of the rags that replaced his clothes, then used his knife to pry open the PDA, pulling it out from underneath. Not the kind worn by stalkers, but an army PDA. And - inoperable. An inscription stuck to the split display for all eternity: "18-07/13/13:32. Swamp 2-12. Stalker Semetsky is dead. Cause of death: Venom bug bite." Yesterday's news. Goupi flipped the PDA. Made, as it should be, in China. Judging by the inventory number, property of the Belgian corps from a unit of the international armed forces.
   Well, it all makes more or less sense now. Burens are notorious kleptomaniacs. They pull like magpies, not what they need, but what shines. He must have stolen the PDA from the soldier too, but he still managed to put a bullet in his head. Scared shitless Burer ran to hide, and wanted to get his stuff too... He may have been shot in the head, but he didn't know that he was dying... Goupi turned the PDA over again. A Burer with a hole in his head couldn't have gotten far from the crime scene. And the military don't just wander around the area. So we can safely assume that the PDA belonged to one of the soldiers guarding the science camp. There's no other military location nearby.
   - Stalker!... Brother...! I can't wait any longer! - the dead stalker howled again.
   - Shut up, you sick bastard," Goupi muttered grudgingly.
   He flicked his nail across the display.
   "Semetzky's dead. Big deal! He'd been dead before. But the Burer, the half-assed bastard, gave his brutal life for a broken PDA. All PDA used in the Zone, both stalker and military, is a cute program called "Kamikaze. As soon as the minicomputer loses contact with its owner, "Kamikaze" famously, like a samurai sword, chops all available information on it. What else could it be? Information is sometimes worth more than pennies. So there was nothing to be said for trying to steal something from the internal data-storage device of the PDA that had been stolen by a Burer. The only thing to do instead of information was to get a spyware virus, which would instantly transfer all the data from your own mini-computer to somebody else's address.
   Glancing at the hapless and therefore badly dead Burer, Goupi grinned almost sympathetically and threw the PDA into the fire. The PDA fell with one edge on the embers, the other hitting a rock. There was a low click, and the edge of the flash drive peeked out from the open receptacle.
   Now this could be interesting!
   Gupi quickly jerked it out of its casing, which was now charred from the embers' heat. He jerked it around in his fingers. It seemed all right. No visible imperfections, in any case. Blowing on it just in case, waving it in the air as if it were hot, Goupi slid it into his PDA's receiver and ran an antivirus program.
   The flash drive had turned out to be clean. Clean as in uninfected. The stick was clean, as in uninfected, and contained only one image file.
   Before he opened the unknown file, Goupi put a mug on the stone, picked up the overturned coffee pot and poured the rest of the coffee from it. There was slightly less than half a cup. That was good. Gupi took a sip. The coffee was getting cold. But unlike other gourmets, Gupi liked his coffee both hot and cold. As long as it was brewed properly. And without a speck of sugar. Then it was all right. And cold coffee with sugar is garbage.
   Gupi finished his coffee and put the mug down on the stone.
   He decided that the file on the memory stick was still there, but he had to get rid of the dead Burer. The dead thing stinks like it's been dead for a week.
   Gupi got to his feet, shouldered his rifle, grabbed the Burer by the hem of the cloak it was wrapped in, and hauled him back to the exit.
   The first thing Goupi did when he was out in the open was to listen. It was a silent night. The stars were reflected in the black water of the lake. Somewhere, far away in the swamp, a creature was howling in a low voice. Maybe it was hungry, maybe it just didn't know how to occupy itself. Gupi activated the life form detector. No one was lurking within ten meters of the cache, waiting for prey.
   - Brother... - was heard again from the side of the shore. - Stalker!... I can't take it anymore! Help!
   Goupi took his submachine gun out from under his elbow and shone his underbarrel torch to where the voice came from. An indistinct, blurring figure stood near the water's edge, swaying like a leaf in the blowing wind. If a dead stalker is walking along the bank, he'd better not go there now, because he'd be sucked down like an ant into a sewer.
   Gupi lowered his assault rifle, grabbed hold of the Burer's dungarees again and dragged him away from the beach. He'd checked this road before, so there was no risk of running into an anomaly. Actually, it would be a good idea to stick a dead Burer in the Roastery, to keep the stinking corpse from attracting the filthy beasts. But the nearest one, marked by Gupi, was a hundred meters away. And a hundred meters in the dark was no hee-hee in the poppy smoke. You might not make it. Or you might not make it, but you might not come back. No, he'd rather let a Burer be gnawed by rats and eaten by crows.
   Stretching himself, Goupi threw the woodcutter into the bushes, wiped his hands on the wet grass, and went back.
   - Stalker...! My friend...! Help! I've lost mine!
   - You bore me, you bastard," Goupi fired a short burst at the dead stalker, and he was gone.
   Probably not for long, though.
   Once inside the hiding place, Gupi tossed some wood on the fire, poured water from the coffee pot, and put it to the fire to keep warm.
   Pulling the sleeve of his camouflage jacket back to the elbow to reveal the display, Gupi peered thoughtfully down at the menu window in the lower right-hand corner.
   Is it even worth seeing what's on the flash drive, the stalker thought to himself. There are some secrets you don't want to know. Though on the other hand, well, what could put on the flash drive warriors that Burer stole the mini-computer? Probably porn... Or pictures of the family... No, ninety-nine percent porn!
   Goupi grinned and jabbed a finger at the glowing "Open" bar.
   What appeared on the display didn't look like pornography. It was a plan, with intersecting lines woven into a bizarre pattern. Individual places on the plan were marked with red or green dots. At five nodes where three or even four lines intersected there were question marks. At about the centre of the web was a black square. At first sight, the picture resembled a child's puzzle, in which it was necessary to find the way to the centre of the labyrinth bypassing dangerous places. The entrances to the labyrinth were marked with numbers - three, eighteen, forty-four, sixty-nine and one hundred and two. Gupi, for fun, tried to follow one of the paths with his eyes, which soon led him to a dead end. The second path was also lost in the red dots, which Gupi interpreted as forbidding signs. But the third path, after wandering around for a while, led the stalker to a black square.
   Goupi smiled happily, shut off the image, and removed the memory stick from the receiver. Military people must be getting busy, playing around with this kind of nonsense. It was a dumb toy - not even a runner. Fucking bourgeois... They want flavored peepifax for the Zone. That's why they're so stupid, they don't know what else they want. They say that a couple of years ago rubber Chinese sneakers became fashionable in the West, which in Soviet times the whole country used to wear. Not because they were stylish, but because there were no other sports shoes. So why, one may ask, did they need those sneakers? It's because none of them have a big, real dream. One that they'd give their life for. And without a dream, what kind of life is life?
   Turning the memory stick between his fingers, like a prestidigitateur, like a coin which might vanish at any second in front of an astounded public, Goupi threw it into the fire.
   The dead stalker, risen from oblivion, howled again beside the lake. Only this time he started another song on the same tune.
   - Mate...! Ah, mate!... Give me some water! I'm so thirsty! Buddy! I got two more wounded here. Give me a hand, Stalker-brother.
   - Fuck you! - Goupi barked back. - Pissing stump!</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_faction_mar_b5_doc_9">
	<text>A tall man of stout build, dressed in threadbare jeans and a black leather jacket, appeared on the outskirts of town N shortly before curfew.
It was early autumn, and the air was clear and cold, with the stranger's sunglasses hiding his features, which looked out of place. He stayed on the street for a while, though, making the short walk from the bus stop to the roadside cafe at a brisk, sweeping pace, not arousing the interest of the rare passers-by who were also hurrying about their business.
When he saw a military patrol appear at a nearby intersection, he quickly climbed the steps of the dilapidated porch, above which a faded sign with an unreadable name was prominently displayed. Once inside, he looked around, made his way to the bar counter, waited patiently for a minute for the bartender to emerge from the back room, then exchanged a few words with him, ordered a beer, and immediately paid and headed for the only occupied table, at which two stalkers were having dinner.
The stranger's unmistakable conclusion about their occupation was based on a few simple observations. First, despite the empty hall, the two occupied the farthest table, so that behind them was a blank wall, and the shop windows and the entrance to the cafe were constantly in view. Secondly, their stilted gestures and intense, watchful glances betrayed a readiness for immediate action, an indication that they were spending most of their time in the death-defying spaces of the Exclusion Zone.
"Lone Stalkers," the stranger mentally corrected himself, crossing the hall deliberately slowly. An interesting type. On the outside, complete opposites of one another. One had a deep scar on the cheek. Dark hair slicked back, nose straight, brown eyes, rude features, massive chin. It's clear that he works more on reflexes in business, trusting his gut entirely.
The second stalker differs sharply from his comrade, at least in appearance. He has short blond hair, eyes with a cool, grayish-green iridescence of pupils, features thin, aristocratic, surprisingly well shaved, in combat for sure a leader, calculating the situation on the move forward.
- Am I intruding? - The stranger paused, removed his dark glasses as a gesture of goodwill, and, without waiting for an invitation, moved his chair to the side of the table so as not to block his view.
- You're not confused, are you? - One of the stalkers, the one with the scar, was frowning at him, disinterested.
- I need a guide.
- No tourists," the blond-haired man cut off coolly but firmly.
- And I am not a tourist. I haven't been in the Zone for two years. Thought I'd come back, but they say things have changed greatly here.
The stalkers glanced around silently, then one of them drew his PDA from his inner jacket pocket.
- Speak.
- Corkscrew," the stranger introduced himself, knowing exactly what he was talking about. His identity could only be verified through the local stalker network, and if the result is positive, all questions to him automatically removed - he can count on help, within reasonable limits and for a reasonable fee, of course
The miniature display glowed dimly.
- A corkscrew, then? - The blond-haired stalker carefully compared the archived image from the net with the original sitting beside him, no emotion evident on his face. - When was the last time you were in the Zone?
- July of '10.
- Rumour has it that at that time a group of stalkers was searching for a path leading to Pripyat, bypassing Radar. Was that true?
Corkscrew nodded.
- Who else went with you?
- Broker, Karas, and Globus. They were dead.
Stalker entered the query, checked the data received, then turned off the PDA and said:
- Let's consider the introductions made. I am Enoch.
- Guron," the other introduced himself without much enthusiasm.
- So? - Corkscrew leaned forward a little. - Can you take us to the Cordon?
- We were to leave in an hour. - Enoch interlocked his fingers, glanced at Guron furtively, caught the doubt in his answering glance, and added, "You won't have time to equip yourself.
- Not a problem," Corkscrew replied. - I have a hiding place at Cordon.
- It's been a long time since you've been to the Zone," Enoch grinned. - The perimeter used to be a sieve. Now it's sealed up tight. You can't get through without special equipment. - He thought for a moment, then nodded: - 'All right. We have the third set of equipment. Only I warn at once: we go without the weapon, military boundary pass silently, in a place specified by me. No shooting. You pay full obedience until we get to Cordon, and ten grand for a set of special equipment.
Corkscrew nodded, almost without hesitation. He didn't seem very interested in money at the moment.
- Why no weapons? - He tensed, though.
- Less of a risk. We have a rule: if the army got us, we don't fight, we pass for 'tourists'. They keep us for a day, they let us go. But if they find a gun on you, they'll smack you on the spot.
- Really? Is that how cool it is now? - Corkscrew was genuinely surprised.
- Six months ago we enforced a strict blockade on allied territories," Enoch explained. - Factions have their own corridors, and free stalkers are in a tight spot.
- So without weapons..." Corkscrew looked puzzled. - What about the Zone? Do we run into mutants? Or on bandits?
- Overseas we have hiding places, - Enoch reassured him. - We'll share with you from our personal reserves. We will not leave you naked.
- Out of respect for your elders? - Corkscrew squinted.
- In memory of our dead, Guron, who had been silent until then, turned darker.
Enoch hesitated, but did not comment on the remark. He only made a mental note to ask him on occasion why he was reacting in such a manner.
- If you agree to the terms, let's go," he said, turning to Corkscrew. - We mustn't linger, it will soon be dark.</text>

	<text>October 18.
...Around midnight we, a group of scientists captured or recruited at different times and in different parts of the world, were brought to a kind of transit point. It was a long journey. Everyone is treated the same. Both those who work for money and those who are intimidated, whose families have been taken hostage.
I am scared. The overlay of civility was too thin. At first we, each of us individually, were driven to an animal state by constant threats, public torture and mockery. Some could not bear the physical pain. Others, brave enough to talk about their importance in the scientific world and the special services, which would surely save them, snapped and lost hope.
In Central Africa, in the temporary staging area where we met for the first time, many perked up. After a long period of isolation, everyone felt much better: we, broken all by ourselves, dreamed that together we would be able to think of a way to escape, or at least to make known the plight in which we found ourselves.
The camp is guarded by mercenaries. They are totally unsociable, but subject to brutal discipline. Any breach is punishable by death.
I look at them and think: our governments could have had a different policy. Instead of leading the world into ruin and chaos, wasting billions on political intrigue and blatant adventure, they should have been concerned about the general welfare and education of the peoples inhabiting the Earth.
After what has been done to me, such thoughts do not seem naive. The senseless abuse to which I have been subjected has not only destroyed my will, but erased many illusions. We are doomed. The world is doomed. I do not know what goals the non-humans who have taken us over have, but they feel they are the absolute masters of the situation. Using the technical achievements of civilisation, they don't give a damn about any of the laws of the civilised world. I am scared. A brute, bestial force breaks the thin walls of consciousness, destroys illusions and creates a persistent sense of hopelessness.
I ask myself: why and how was this possible?
The answer is simple and floats to the surface: half a century of double standards and blatant double-dealing has created an illusion of impunity for many groups operating under the wings of a number of governments. We ourselves have nurtured a new strain of the plague. A moral plague. This can be seen particularly clearly from here, from the bottom of the abyss into which we have had to fall.
October 25th.
Keeping a diary.
My past horror is nothing compared to what I've just experienced.
Our escape plan has been discovered. It turns out there were provocateurs among us. They had thrown everybody out of the barracks and lined us up in the dusty square, then the brutal mercenaries, on the orders of a pale, gaunt, European-looking "gentleman", had thrown every fifth man out of the ranks.
They were shot before our eyes.
My hands were trembling. I could hardly keep a stump of pencil in my fingers.
They were killed without any pity, brutally, with pleasure. The bodies were left lying in the dust, a minute later flies were swarming over them.
I could no longer bear the constant moral pressure, the debilitating fear. The only form of protest I was capable of was these notes. If they are found, I will certainly be killed. It becomes horrible, sometimes I am ashamed of myself. I do not have the strength to die with dignity, throwing myself on the guard - the lust to live is too great in my mind. I don't understand why they need a geneticist. All my life I have devoted to the development of genetically modified plants, only began experiments on animals, grafting representatives of rare, endangered species some inherent qualities, which should help them survive in the rapidly changing biosphere of the Earth.
My resistance has finally been broken. For a year now, the incessant nightmare has continued. There is no more hope.
November 14 (approximately).
We are being taken somewhere. We are being transported in the filthy hold of an old, breathing ship.
The conditions are inhuman. The constant rocking is maddening.
The constant torment suggests self-torture. How much hardship can a person endure? Where is the point beyond which fear disappears, where hope for a mythical salvation ceases to thrive?
Among those trapped in the cesspool-like hold I cannot see many familiar faces. Little by little I come to realise that we were being filtered there, in the camp. The number of specialists from different fields of knowledge was evidently too great to begin with. In the course of the elimination process, the toughest of the toughest were eliminated for the edification of the weak.
A win-win tactic.
No one would think of resisting any longer. Many have fallen into a complete depression. It would seem that if our tormentors are going to use our prisoners for scientific research or experiments, we must not be led into a state of complete apathy, indifference to our own fate.
I fear we may be subjected to illegal drugs upon arrival.
Not drugs.
December.
Our agony is over.
The ship reaches the port of destination. Where we are and where we will be taken next is an absolute mystery. Fire hoses were lowered into the hold, we were stripped naked, our clothes turned to rags, pieces of soap were thrown in and water was turned on, and we were ordered to clean up.
After washing, several mercenaries acted as barbers. We were shaved naked, again treated as if we were animals.
Gradually I was beginning to get used to the state of existence. The past life was a dream, a delirium of an inflamed consciousness.
Bales of clothes were waiting for us on the deck.
Each one picked out his own things. A piercing, cold wind was blowing, so no one had to be whipped.
The clothes were clean, worn, but of good quality. I tried to count how many of us were left. It came out that there were about a hundred of us.
My consciousness, sobered by the icy wind, began to work again, coming out of the doom-like slumber.
I tried to talk to the others, to find out something. The information is scanty and utterly joyless. There is a persistent rumour that we have been brought to one of the countries of the former Soviet Union. I have heard several times the opinion that our captivity and all the abuse we have endured were the work of the KGB.
The latter seemed to me doubtful. Each of us has delusions of genius in our heads, but if we are honest and impartial, we are no more than average experts. There are no geniuses among us. Good performers with a high level of specialized training, capable of picking up and successfully developing a certain idea. No more than that. Considering the scientific potential scattered by the vortex of perestroika and the hard times of the nineties all over the post-Soviet space I am coming to the conclusion that the local special services definitely do not need us.
It's scary to think about, but the one advantage of all the countries of the region without exception is practically total powerlessness. It is easy to hide traces of any adventure here.
Soon it will be the new year 2000. Millennium is coming. Is the predicted end of the world really coming?
December 25th (for sure).
We are put on buses.
The mercenaries are not hiding their weapons. The road, paved at first, now looks like a country lane. We look out of the windows in silence. Behind them are bleak, grey landscapes. Winter without snow. Squalid villages drift by.
I drifted off to sleep for a while.
I woke up to a jolting sensation. Outside the dusk windows of the bus, I could see a chillingly unreal landscape: a dead city, deserted by its people. Our convoy moves slowly along one of the streets. My knowledge of Russian is enough to make out the letters on one of the signs.
Street of Heroes of Stalingrad.
Rare snowflakes fall from the sky, slowly circling. The mud is frozen, turning into bumps. I look around and everywhere I see signs of a suddenly stopped life, as if someone is projecting similar black and white photographs on the window: gloomy houses with their windows darkened, street lights not working, rusty cars with deflated tyres, shop windows behind which half-empty counters with leftovers can be seen in the light of bus headlights, snow-covered playgrounds, swings squeaking in the wind, a doll left in a sandpit...
The bus rises to a hillside. The contours of some fundamental buildings are vaguely outlined on the horizon.
My neighbour, an expert in cybernetics, suddenly leans over and whispers in my ear:
- This is the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. I have been visiting it since before the accident. We are now moving through Pripyat, the dead, abandoned city of power engineers.
His whisper is scalding.
The buses suddenly turn off and suddenly....
We drive down a sloping ramp leading underground.
A clammy terror grips me.
Timelessness...
I do not know how many months or years have passed since we were brought to the old, Soviet-era underground missile complex. The bunker zone, stretching for many kilometres, has become a haven for mind and body, but I have already lost track of time and have no hope for anything else.
My hopes of escape or escape melted away as the meaning of the experiments being conducted here became clearer.
Those who captured us and keep us underground hate Humanity, despise the civilisation that nurtured them. They are preparing for the apocalypse. The kinds of weapons being developed here surpass the most delusional and fantastic ideas. We're really being used as industrious artisans. Everyone is given a narrow scope of work. I now know that I am engaged in the development of other people's ideas, research stopped somewhere on the brink of a foul.
The genetic changes made by the viruses created in the laboratories will spare no one. They serve to totally destroy the enemy, but before they die, people and some species of pets, for which strains of genetic viruses are designed, will be endowed with extraordinary abilities and serve as weapons. The world will perish or be changed unrecognisably. Take dogs, for example. Here, in the dungeons of the bunker zone, two strains of virus have already been weaponised, altering the sensorics of their "human friends" and endowing them with unusual survivability and hypertrophied fury. Pseudo-dogs exhibit mental powers over an inferior sub-species, the so-called blind dogs, due to the changes they have made to their brain structure. They can control them.
I am no longer afraid.
I have become an accomplice not just in a crime, but in the preparation of a mass genocide of mankind. I don't understand what those behind the experiments are counting on. Are they so stupid or insane that they hope to survive? In other laboratories I have seen terrifying creatures created from humans. The most terrifying spawn of the experiments are the controllers. They are capable of influencing the psyches of other mutants, gathering them into battle groups.
This is INHUMANITY at its most terrifying and cynical.
Timelessness.
I was recently receiving reagents from a warehouse. A few kilometres away from the biology laboratories there happens to be a section for physicists. There I met an old man. He seemed vaguely familiar to me, and when we exchanged a few words with him, I was horrified to recognize a young and undoubtedly talented scientist whom I had met in a past life at a conference on synergetics and the formation of related branches of knowledge existing at the interface of different sciences. He did not seem to remember me. He had no personality left. Only the creepy fanaticism of a researcher. He speaks indecipherable, often and inappropriately rattling off incomprehensible terms. It's amazing how I had the courage and patience to talk to him.
The creepiest thing is that I have managed to understand that he has almost completed the setup that suppresses a person's personality. Only primitive reflexes remain. He claims that another device being developed by a "related party" can be used to control enemy soldiers whose minds will be suppressed - for the time being, however, within a radius of a dozen kilometres at most. They become obedient, but not to the will of man or controller. They fall under the influence of a second emitter, controlled by a cybernetic system.
Timelessness...
I fear nothing any more. My life is over. I am morally dead, and physical suffering is no longer frightening.
I remember the dead city we rode through once upon a time. Would the whole Earth turn into a vast graveyard, where mutants and cybernetic-led undead would reign?
I suffered, feared, clung to life, wriggled like a worm. Now I am dead. My last wish is to do something to avert the coming catastrophe.
Until all the research is complete, until the strains of genetic viruses are brought to a degree of stability where they can be put into action with the expectation of a hundred percent result, until the Burner and its mysterious component controlling the behaviour of people who have lost their own minds has passed its final tests, I have to do something.
I couldn't live with dignity, but I finally found the strength to die.
Releasing all the pseudo dogs and blind dogs in the lab. Might be able to get to the next sector and free some controllers.
I've heard that the exclusion zone area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is controlled by one of the isolation forces. I hope they are not in collusion with the mercenaries and their masters guarding us. Dogs have broken out of their cages before - nobody will make a big fuss at first, but when the mercenaries understand the scale of what has happened it will be too late.
I hope...</text>

	<text>-Do you want coffee?
-Did they fix the machine yet? -The girl was clearly flirting with the boy, a smile appearing on her face more like a smirk. The young man opposite was smiling with his whole face and inviting her to follow him with his hand. They both walked down the white corridor, which was full of deadlocked doors. Some of them had not been opened for years, others had a new seal on them. There were pipes running along the walls. They arced beautifully around doorways, instrument racks of some kind, and generators. Some went to the floor, others to the ceiling. I often saw representatives of the station - people in respirators and white coats. They were bustling about all the time. Their work was fidgety, and those precious minutes when they went out for a coffee or a smoke in the special room were comparable to a meal. People dependent on work, people living on work. The young people themselves were also dressed in dressing gowns, proudly displaying the badge: "Senior assistant to the head of the third desk. Ludmila Strizhenova" and "Security Officer Dmitry Ustenko".
-Lud, which one do you want?
-Give me a cappuccino. Man, I'm so tired! -The luxurious black curls were gathered in a bun. The girl herself was at that age where they say last chance to get married. But at a fleeting meeting it was easy to guess her age, a working girl who had recently graduated from an institute. First impressions often fail.
-It's all right, it's Thursday.
-What's the date?
-The twelfth. We have a professional "holiday" coming up. It's April after all...
-Yeah, it gets better by the hour. -Twenty-two years ago, life stopped here. It's like someone turned off the lights, it's weird. You know, sometimes I think that humanity itself did it. Consciously, laughing at nature, and now we just spit on what we've done. All we do is sit around and try to do we don't know what. And laughing at who? We're laughing at ourselves.
-You're telling the truth. It's not for us to decide all this, let alone to judge. There are big men in offices, they sit in fancy chairs covered in leather. They just sit there and decide how we should live our lives. And there -Dima raised his index finger to the ceiling- there is someone to manage everything. To build "patterns" by which we live our lives, and make decisions about the rest of our lives. Man has nothing to do with it...
-Since when did you become a believer?
-When there's not much left, faith is the answer.
-It's interesting, by the way, we have a routine inspection today, the bosses are coming. Somebody said our safety standards are being violated. So they're coming to give us a pat on the head. Thank God I'm just an assistant. 
-Senior assistant. -Dmitri took Lyudin's "badge" and turned it in his hands with a smile.
-Come on! Now would have harnessed me. Tour them around the station, but look fearfully in the mouth, say, what they want to ask ... Nausea.
-You've all got snitches there. Well, look at them, Lud! Seriously, get the hell out of here. What's there to do at this station? We've been trying to get something going since '86. And what's the result? The only thing that's running is the first power generating unit, giving us and the security system of the rest of the "units" electricity. We, as they say, can only dream about production capacity. It's sad to realize that good nuclear specialists and physicists with two higher educations are rotting. In the truest sense of the word... And the authorities have decided to raise "permissible value of radiation". They have to pump us full of antibiotics or whatever they call it! One thing is, they think it's cheaper than upgrading the equipment, the sarcophagus and properly reburying the fuel, reprocessing it. The "UN" has been promising funds for this for ten years... More and more people die of radiation sickness because of these "regulations". Von Vovchik got cancer.... They buried him last week with the whole shift.
-Dim, it's not because of radiation. Yes, the background's rising, but it's all within the norm. Of course, it's ours, it's kind of normal, but still. We're getting all the treatments. It's something else. This place is cursed. Actually, there's not supposed to be a station here, remember? There's an old story about a black forest. Well, we were told them when we were kids.
-Yes, yes. How could I forget. This place is cursed, you're right. Why don't you go away after all? And then maybe I'll move in with you... closer. - Dima smiled and leaned towards the girl. They kissed softly, but then shyly stopped.
-Dim. I've told you many times before. My family is buried here, where shall I go? They all died in Pripyat. When the buses were jammed. That's it... not another word about it. Give me a hug. 
	Two people, kindred spirits, stood hugging against the wall not far from the coffee machine. They felt what is usually called love, but were afraid of it. Work, a demanding job for both of them cautioned the mind, but the heart took over time and again.  Only a sudden jolt cut short the sweet moments of their meeting which they so often lacked.
-All staff to their posts! - The siren was ringing off the hook. - This is not a drill! All staff to your posts!
-What's that? - Lyudmila was frightened, Dima was only surprised, his military training and years of experience did not allow him to panic. He helped Lyudmila up from the floor. Shaking off his girlfriend, Ustenko took her hands and looked into her eyes. Probably wanted to make sure everything was all right, or maybe he was just reassuring.
-No idea. Get to your posts now! Luda! Pull yourself together! - Several men ran down the corridor. One of them was holding his nose, which was bleeding. The other kept shifting from running to stepping and from stepping to running. After all, the station staff had not passed any sporting standards. They did not even know how to shoot, even though there were several points in the regulations. Everything depended on funding and the money that Kyiv allocated was just barely enough to publish a book on safety rules at the station for the personnel, and for a couple of seminars a year. Refresher and advanced training courses were a rarity. The station itself worked only on its own internal resources. It was not profitable for someone to bury it and everything connected with it. The place was being poked and prodded and studied. Closely. Dissecting every inch of the earth, of the air. Greedily sucking up the knowledge gained, at the cost of the lives of ordinary people... working men.
	Ludmila nodded frightenedly to Dmitri, and gathering her remaining thoughts, ran forward down the corridor ... Dima "flashed" a few meters behind her went to the stairwell, descended a couple of floors and ran down another corridor, he was in a room similar to a computer lab. There were about seven LCD monitors on the far wall. Some displayed important instrument readings, others had video from surveillance cameras. Along with that there were about ten other people in the room, already seated and waiting for their "superiors".
-What have we got? - Dimitri was all ears. His question sounded not to anyone in particular, but to everyone in the room. Today he was running the parade.
-Dmitry Vladimirovich. The tremors were recorded, four and a half points. Background levels have doubled in one minute and continue to rise. 
-Damage to the sarcophagus hull?
-It's not registering!  What was that? - Personnel incompetence manifested itself in the everyday life of the station. Somewhere they'll forget to salute, because the station is under military jurisdiction. Somewhere they would be addressed by name, to a superior, not by the regulations. Even the usual order of the dialogue "superior - subordinate" was violated, almost every minute. The practical knowledge of the rank and file also left much to be desired. In Kiev they have long ago got used to this "dump", which needs to be fed and did not particularly care about the training of personnel. They let a couple of scientists to the station, and let them teach people.
-I don't know myself. - Dima stood beside his computer and carried out diagnostics of some systems. A positive result allowed him to breathe easy. Only repeated jolts cut short a second of relief. Everyone fell to the floor. Things fell from desks and plaster fell from the ceiling in hail on people's heads. One of the monitors on the wall sagged and snagged three more as it fell. There was a scraping of metal and plastic and shouting.
-The level increased eightfold. - Excitedly concluded a man in his thirties, who had already made it to the consoles after the end of the jolts. He had white hair, but it looked as if white hair had formed during the tremors. It was scary.
"-All staff" - "Turn the bloody alarm off! Everyone is already at their posts. - Ustenko began to lose his temper. - Sashka and Marina. Diagnose the whole station on the consoles. Go through the cameras. Sergey, contact Kiev. We've had an accident...
 A frantic rush began in the room, no one stood idly by, and the instrument readings continued to rise. Dmitri was not so much surprised as surprised. He was in a bit of shock, which was not allowed in his position. The tremors, and even at Chernobyl, were the first in the history of his work. And most likely in the history of Chernobyl.
-Volodya, monitoring of the sarcophagus. Permanent! If you try to distract me, I'll strangle you right here. Right. We're lowering the rods on the first one, what are you doing? You were supposed to lower them two hours ago according to the plan! Vitya, signal to the third panel. Let them lower the rods of the first power unit. Urgent! 
-That's right! - The boy leaned over and with a new breath began his message addressed to the third panel. The work of these people, just like Dmitri's, forced them to be cold-blooded at any moment. But to prepare them for all the wonders of nature, apparently not in time. - Dimitri Vladimirovich. The order has been refused. They're having a panic attack, I think.
-What is it?! Put the reactor rods down right now! We're going to fucking explode, cool them down fast. Quickly! Sergei, where's the connection to Kiev? 
-The phones aren't working!
-First monitor to console three! Quickly!
-That's right. - A picture appeared on one of the surviving monitors. A few people lying on the floor were barely moving. The others were standing right under the camera, waving their arms vigorously, shouting something. After a few seconds, all four stopped waving and turned their heads to the right. A strange light illuminated their faces. Dimitri only managed to make out how Luba turned to the camera and said something before the flash knocked out the camera.
-Ljuba? - he muttered softly. - Where is the image? Quickly return the image of the third remote to me! - In response he received only incomprehensible looks from his colleagues.
-Dmitry Vladimirovich! -The sarcophagus is completely sealed.
-Radiation level? - Dmitry was laconic. He had to pull himself together.
-It's ten times the norm.
-Yeah, what the hell?! - Ustenko rushed to one of the desks, -He has to work, he has to! - picked up the red phone and waited for an answer...</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_b6_doc_9">
	<text>Cordon is not in vain considered a hallmark of the Zone, which she cheekily pokes the nose of each crossed the perimeter of the green stalker. So, here it is - the Zone - and here is what it can offer you to get acquainted with its patterns. Be careful: right in front of you is a treacherous anomaly. (Can't you see it? Trust me - it is definitely there. And if you don't believe me, check it out. Or don't you?) Nearby, there's a few low-value artifacts, and over there, near an abandoned farm, are vicious, dumb, and perpetually hungry mutants. But that's not the whole range of the Zone. Want to know more about it? No problem, let's move on. If you don't feel like it, get out while you still can. However, if you do take the offer, you'll be delighted. A full range of extreme entertainment awaits you as soon as you pass the last roadblock and leave Kordon, you will find yourself in real "business". From that moment on, it will be much harder to break the contract, and as a forfeit on it the Zone can claim your life. Those are the rules. No one called you here, but since you're here, you'll have to obey... 
Major Konstantin Kupriyanov, aka Operative-Intruder Department, working under the code name Kalter, was not only once bit a bitch-life and looked at the "business card" Zone, immediately realized with what nasty creature he will deal. However, unlike other adventurers who signed a contract with her on a voluntary basis, the major had no choice. In this deal he was merely the executor of his command's orders. And it did not give Kalter the right to reject cooperation with the Zone on the basis of personal dislike for it. So the intruder, peering through binoculars at Kordon from the first hill in his path, gritted his teeth in frustration and headed southwest to the meeting point with the informant. 
Heavy gray clouds crept so low over Calter's head that he felt as if he could reach them with his hand. The eternally overcast, leaden sky of the Zone looked like an additional sarcophagus, built by the mighty forces of nature over the main one over the Fourth Chernobyl Reactor and the surrounding area. In this matter Mother Nature clearly did not trust her careless child, the builder of the first Sarcophagus, the man, so she reinsured. And how is it to be trusted - in fact nobody else but man has constructed in these places a nuclear power station and has allowed one of its reactors to explode a quarter of century ago. The consequences of that explosion are still stirring not only Europe but the whole world, watching intently what is happening in the Zone. 
Somewhere behind the clouds, the sun, a welcome but rare guest in these parts, was hiding. It would not make an appearance today. Rather, it would be raining by midday. The dry grass and the yellowing leaves on the trees rustled in the wind, and Kalter couldn't believe how green they had once been. The Major would rather believe that the local flora grows already dry and rotted, because he could not imagine how in the Zone buds swell on the trees and emerald young grass grows out of the ground. If anything is born in abundance on this cursed radioactive land, it is anomalies. And who ever thought of giving them that term? Flowers, lush meadows, ordinary, not mutated into monsters, animals and birds - that is what the Zone is anomalous. And deadly pockets of paranormal energy are the norm by local standards. 
As well as total squalor, devastation and "constantly changing", cold wind, sometimes changing its direction several times a minute. The Major hated to admit it, but he was afraid of the local wind, for it was not just unfamiliar - it was alien. Even the dry, hot winds of the Middle East and Central Asia, where Kalter had been called upon often in his line of duty, were far more familiar to him than the air element that was now blowing in his face. And if only it had been the peculiar, mostly disturbing smells of the Zone. No, in reality it was far more complicated than that. Kalter couldn't explain what was causing this 'anti-smell' rejection reaction in him. Probably, along with the usual smells in the local air hovered the vibe of the very anomalies and mutants that were preparing to imprison the intruder here in their deadly embrace. 
A disgusting cocktail of eerie aromas: constant fear of death, hatred, the unknown, and general withering. The Zone presented Kalter with a dirty, rust-covered cup filled to the brim with this foul-smelling drink, and the Major had to drain it to the bottom. What could he do - fate, and the Major had no control over it. The mighty Office decided everything for him, and if it ordered Kalter to drink it, he would choke, but he drank the drink to the last drop. And so it was, and so it is. No one knows what will happen next. When we live and see... 
A quarter of a century ago the place of the southern sector of the Cordon, through which and entered the zone Kalter was a Soviet collective farm, and, apparently, quite rich. The vast long-overgrown grassy fields, dilapidated farms, dryers, grain silos, machine shops and garages, and abandoned everywhere rusted through machinery... After walking through the woods a couple of miles, the Major even came across a small factory, which today can not be determined the purpose. At first Calter wanted to go there to climb up onto the roof of a two-story hall to study the surroundings, but as he got closer he discovered that the factory was inhabited. A dozen armed men in worn leather jackets were camping there, or guarding some precious cargo. But clearly not the kind of cargo the invading Major was interested in. 
Intruder hid in the bushes and switched on a directional microphone, aimed it at the company lurking behind the peeling walls. But he soon abandoned the reconnaissance, and bypassed the factory and continued on his way. A brief radio listen was enough for Kalter to realise who he had stumbled upon. The specific jargon used by the gangs of outlaws in the Zone made it possible to disguise this crowd even in the dark - also, so to speak, the calling card of one of the local pack-predators. 
To get to the village where the informer sought by Kalter lived, the major had to cross the only short asphalt road in the area, on which army patrols intermittently rode. Unlike the bandits, the intruder could do so openly - the military observer papers issued to him were genuine. However, by showing his face early to the soldiers of the local peacekeeping contingent, Kalter could attract the attention of the men the Strategist had marked him as a 'nuisance'. Which would force them to be wary and reschedule an illegal arms deal planned for somewhere in the Zone. So the intruder decided to cross the road the way he had been taught as a child: before stepping onto the carriageway, look carefully left to right to avoid any excesses. However, even a completely deserted road would be lurking in these parts. 
The last hundred meters to the obstacle Kalter had to move across open ground, and when he had creeped half that distance the damned patrol suddenly appeared on the road. The soldiers were moving leisurely towards a second - internal - roadblock, one kilometre to the north, near a crumbling railway bridge that had once crossed the same road. The soldiers were accompanied by three civilians in hooded windbreakers and simple respirators over their faces. Collected team of immature Stalkers and the army might have seemed strange intruder, if he had not been advised that such a thing is the order of the day at Cordon. Almost every inhabitant of the Zone, whether he was a hardened bandit, even a rank-and-file soldier, had his own little business here. Even the military stalkers, career members of the army special forces, did not care about the instructions and quietly peddled the collected artefacts. But simple mechanized infantry, which is forbidden to go into the depths of contaminated territories, earned their demob, as they say, not leaving the barracks. For example, escorting newly minted stalkers through the Cordon, so they do not prematurely ran into bandits or mutants, and incidentally reading a brief briefing to youngsters on behavior in the Zone. 
It was just such a group that the intruder stumbled upon as he approached the road. He and the patrol were still a fair distance apart, but the Major chose not to take any chances. Having spotted unwanted witnesses, he rushed to the first shelter that came his way: a rusty Belarus tractor standing in a ditch, its tyres long since decayed and turned into rags. An anomaly might well have been underneath, but luckily Kalter was lucky, and even the tractor's radiation didn't have much of a buzz on it. He crouched under the tractor's underside, and hid behind the massive hub of the rear wheel, becoming practically part of the overhanging pile of junk. Fortunately the colour of Major's camouflage overalls was designed by the Ministry's laboratory specially for the conditions of the Zone and allowed him to hide unnoticed even in dumps, even in the fields, even on the bare rocks. Especially since the intruder had to play this kind of hide-and-seek for two decades, and the fact that he was still alive was direct proof of his ability to deceive the "watermen". And there were times when they were just as good as Kalter himself. Of all the Pakistani "black storks" that the Major encountered last year near Peshawar ... 
The Major had only been in the Zone for a few hours and was just getting to know the rules of life here. "Take your time and look around!" - was one of them. A renowned veteran of the Ministry's Misanthrope Special Unit, field operative Kalter had been to no less despicable places. But at least there he had encountered common, and not 'abnormal', enemies whose behaviour was by and large predictable. Here, however, it was impossible to predict even his next move, let alone the rest of the local quirks. So Kalter tried not to make a fuss, even if he was pressed for time. The irrational order of the Zone demanded that the major thoroughly understand it, because, piously observing the secrecy, the Office did not provide for a guide for him. They assumed that the "misanthrope" would be able to figure it out. But even after a short walk around the Cordon, Kalter began to doubt it. Orders were orders, and that rule prevailed over any that the Intruder had yet to comprehend. 
For now the only foe he had to fight to the death was the overly aggressive fauna. Like any misanthrope, the Major preferred to examine an unfamiliar opponent in combat, though of course Kalter would not get into a fight unless absolutely necessary. The Intruder had no intention of engaging mutants, but sometimes the sentient beasts would reveal their disguises and take a closer look at him. 
The easiest thing to do was to get rid of the pack of blind dogs that met Calter immediately at the outer wire fence. Half a dozen of the ugly beasts darted away as soon as they heard the cocking of the bolt. The Major didn't even have to shoot. The way of thinking of eyeless dogs worked in a right direction - someone from stalker evidently taught this pack of shabby beasts of prey wisely, once again confirming the postulate of grandfather Pavlov about conditioned reflexes. 
However, this brief warm-up ended, giving way to an endless tournament, in which the main and only prize for Kalter was his own life, valued by the Ministry, in truth, far more highly than by the "misanthrope" himself. 
A fat barrel-shaped creature on long and thin legs, as if a giant grasshopper, nicknamed by stalkers pseudo-flesh, did not intend to eat the Major, but he had to shoot it anyway. Something or someone had spooked the mutant, and it galloped straight at the intruder lurking in the tall grass. And if he hadn't taken the monster down with his compact VMK-3.0, complete with integrated silencer and multi-purpose underbarrel rocket launcher, the pseudo-flesh would have come charging at Kalter, breaking his ribs and stomping on his kidneys. 
And with pseudo-dogs that hung around a bandit-occupied factory and smelled a man lurking in the bushes, it was an embarrassment that nearly ended in tears for the Major. He hastily decided to get rid of the pseudopods with Paniker, a special repellent developed by the Ministry's laboratory to repel predatory animals quickly and effectively. He spared no effort to see if these fierce, fangy and, unlike the first pack he'd encountered, highly intelligent creatures would be frightened by the click of the bolt. Neither was he likely to shoot at them at first. Fire from an automatic rifle, even one with a good silencer, would have reached the ears of the two-legged small arms predators near the outlaw's camp. 
Seeing the fleeing pseudo-dog pack turn around and head for him, Kalter grabbed the required express spray gun from his off-loading waistcoat and 'sneezed' it towards the approaching beast. After that he took a warning shot - what if the chemical agent taken by the major on a business trip would not work? 
I looked straight into the water. At first everything seemed to go smoothly. The pseudo-dogs darted away and scurried around, smelling the Panic Beetle, which was undetectable to the human nose. Great," the Major mentally summed up the field test of the experimental repellent. - At least one of the new developments of our 'fatheads' has paid off the budget money spent on it." 
But no sooner had Kalter put the sprayer back into the "unloader", than the pseudo-dogs again gathered in a friendly flock and rushed towards the man, already celebrating the victory. If not for a nearby tree, uprooted from the ground, Major would have hardly escaped the clash with an angry horde of four-legged mutants without a scratch. He hastily scrambled up the fallen tree trunk, then hastily climbed to a height beyond the reach of the pseudo-pigs, mentally thanking the elements for bringing down the mighty ash tree. He thanked himself for always being diligent in his running and climbing training (there were no unscrupulous runners or climbers in Misanthrope). 
Intruder looked around to see if the chase had attracted the attention of the factory bandits. Then, checking to see if the chase had attracted the factory's attention, he deliberately fired single shots at the salivating mutants, darting under the tree. After which he vowed to forget about non-lethal means of self-defense and not to let the anomalous inhabitants of the Zone at close range. Although a minute later he realized that he had made a foolish oath - is it possible in the Zone did not do anything to forbid? 
With the detection of high radioactivity and anomalies - these malignant bursts of unknown energy - the intruder did not seem to have any problems. Dangerous radiation was picked up by an active dosimeter. Well, going to the included stalker PDA - a hybrid of shockproof PDA and handheld radar - anomaly detector recorded the nearest their sources, notifying about them by an annoying vibration signal ("beeper" Major for obvious reasons immediately turned off). In addition, Kalter soon learned to identify some of the energy traps by sight - they gave themselves away either by emanating from them a haze, or electrical flashes, or phosphorescent glow. 
But no matter how fine-tuned the detector was, and no matter how keen his own eyesight, Calter had almost missed the threat a couple of times. Even before the encounter with the pseudo-dogs, the Major had almost run into a "vortex", mistaking it for its harmless atmospheric variety. Just at that moment, Kalter was looking at another nearby anomaly, a more conspicuous "springboard" than the vortex, and assumed that was what the detector was signaling. Almost got into trouble (to put it mildly!), the intruder learned two important lessons from the incident. First: he began to rely less on the detector - like any electronics, it was not immune to failure. And the second: he put the stalker's rule "Don't hurry and look around" to the tune of a sticky song and kept playing it over and over in his head till figuratively it was imprinted in the major's subcortex. 
However, even this every second vigilance did not always help. After shooting the pseudo-dogs, Kalter jumped out of the tree and nearly burned himself on the top of the "burning fluff" that was hanging from a branch of a fallen ash tree. Had the intruder not known beforehand what this anomaly mimicking the usual weeping vegetation looked like, his victory over the pack of mutants would have been greatly marred. Not to say worse - completely nullified. 
Only now did the Major truly regret the blunder he had made. Namely: not taking with him a proven stalker means of exploring the path ahead - a bag of iron bolts. The oversight was the kind of thing Calter-level intruders would be embarrassed to allow. "I've never carried junk in my pockets before! - He thought contemptuously as he studied the Zone files Strateg had collected for him. - I'll manage somehow without bolts, I was not born yesterday! What the hell do I need eyes, ears, and a lot of expensive electronics for, anyway? 
Zona could only laugh at Kalter's arrogance. At times he thought he could even hear the snide chuckle of the creature, whose consistently scowling countenance didn't seem to suggest it had a sense of humor. Or maybe it wasn't a giggle at all, but an alien wind howling through the wreckage of mangled machinery and the ruins of the surrounding farms...? 
After this string of unfortunate incidents, each of which could easily have resulted in death, Kalter had become doubly cautious. From personal experience the intruder knew that sooner or later he would be faced with a problem he could not easily solve. The zone is generous with surprises, and for one pleasant, such as a found a precious artifact, is always half a hundred deadly. 
The army patrol Kalter encountered was not, of course, such a danger in itself. But it inevitably caused the Major a whole host of other difficulties. After passing the rusty "Belarus" and the intruder lurking under it in the ditch, the soldiers and stalkers walked another fifty meters and approached the booth of the bus stop, preserved from the old times. A similar structure on the opposite side of the road had been razed to the ground, and the surviving booth was the only convenient shelter from the rain that had just begun to drizzle over the southern Kordon. 
The rain was light and generally harmless, so the patrol leader, with a glance at the sky, ordered the soldiers to continue on their way. However, the stalkers did not want to get wet and after a short discussion decided to sit out the bad weather in the booth. The more so as there was nothing to go to the second checkpoint, and the newcomers did not need a guide in principle. So, they parted ways: the military went north, while the three stalkers settled under the lean-to, lit a tablet of dry fuel, and began to heat up on it, one by one, cans with canned food. Kalter noticed that all the newcomers were armed with pistols, which the boys had thoughtfully taken out of their pockets to keep their weapons ready at all times. 
The Major, crouched on the ground, scolded himself mentally: shit - now to get out of the stalkers' sight and past the unfortunate road, he would have to crawl quite a distance. One can, of course, reject conspiracy and get over the obstacle right here in the open. And the curious questions of the trio, which they would probably want to ask the first stalker they encountered, simply ignore. However, it should not be forgotten that the newcomers in the booth would soon have to cross a second checkpoint, where they might blab to the soldiers about the unsociable wanderer in the strange overalls. So the intruder was not at liberty to reveal his presence. 
Kalter had already started to crawl out from under the tractor when he suddenly noticed some movement nearby. Wanting to find out who else was out there besides the three stalkers, the Major crouched down again, peeking carefully out from behind the wheel to get a closer look. 
At first intruder thought that the man, walking along the ditch parallel to the road, had also spotted him and squatted down to make himself more inconspicuous. But as soon as he resumed movement, Kalter immediately realized that if the subject had once been human, he was no longer even formally human, since he had long since been listed as a snark in the web-based stalker directories. With the obligatory notation: an intelligent and extremely dangerous mutant. 
Strong and incredibly bouncy snorks had more the habits of a chimpanzee: they moved in zigzag leaps, leaning on four limbs, and attacking victims, not biting them, but beating them to death with crushing blows. At the same time they felt no pain at all, so they had no concern for self-preservation and were always covered from head to toe with non-healing wounds. 
The most curious thing about snorks, though, and one that remains a mystery to this day among researchers in the Zone, is another. This evil mutant somehow terribly shy of his face, or rather, muzzle, and hides it in every way, loving to use for this purpose old gas mask, which can easily be found in all corners of the Zone. That is why, from a distance, or in semi-darkness it seems that the head of a snark is completely bald, his eyes - the size of an Olympic medal, and instead of a nose - half a meter trunk, in fact - a piece of gas mask hose. In other words, a mutant is a mutant, both physically and mentally. 
At the sight of the leaping monster, Kalter did not fall into such a delusion, for he had taken a course in theoretical "mutant science" before being sent to the Zone. And so the Major decided that if he would lie in the shelter and not move, the snark would not notice him and would soon leave. Or not leave, but will think to hunt down the three inexperienced stalkers sitting in the booth. They were unaware of the threat, munching on warmed canned food and drinking canned beer. What carelessness, mentally scolded the intruder, who had already learned from bitter experience the consequences of overconfidence in the Zone. Don't they know where they are, or do they think they are safe because they are near a roadblock? They should have sent out a lookout before they sat down to lunch. Snork had no thought of lurking, so he was clearly visible from the road. But the lads weren't looking around, though the soldiers must have briefed them on basic precautions in this wilderness. 
The Major had no intention of bailing out the company of careless stalkers. He had his orders, for which he would not hesitate to sacrifice at least all the stalkers of the Zone, put together. If Kalter suffered from attacks of nobility, not only would he not be given the job, but would not have been admitted to the Office. Misanthrope Special Branch intruders are not bargaining chips like most field operatives, whom the command was willing to sacrifice without regret if the situation demanded it. Huge sums of money were expended on the training of each Misanthrope, and the intruders' level of risk prior to the upcoming mission was calculated down to the percentage. And if Kalter began every time on such occasions to play the self-sacrificing hero, he would endanger not only his own precious life but also, however pompous it may sound, the security of his country. The Major's sense of responsibility for it was instilled as firmly as his survival skills. And so the intruder would always and everywhere take only those risks authorized by his direct commander, Strategos. Kalter recognized no other risk. 
Holding his breath, the Major kept his eyes on the snorkel. The latter, in turn, froze and became alert, listening to the voices coming from the booth. Calter had already mentally wished the careless stalkers good luck, when suddenly the damned mutant turned his head in his direction and peered at the tractor through the glass rounds of his gas mask. 
The creature could not hear the Major unequivocally. The intruder hadn't made a sound since he'd detected it, and the snark's ears were hidden beneath the rubber mask. Seeing it was also doubtful. You might have eagle eyesight, but you can hardly see anything beyond your own outstretched hand, looking at the world through the smudged and cracked glasses of a gas mask. So the snark smelled the lurking "misanthrope" either through his sense of smell, by smelling it through the corrugated hose, or by some other sense unknown to man in the sixth, seventh, or eighth sense. And a reasonable mutant had enough brains to know: it is much easier to deal with a single stalker, than with a whole group of these bipedal creatures. 
What snarks in combat, Kalter knew only from the available in the archives of the Office indistinct video footage filmed in the Zone by amateur stalkers. However, the Major could not imagine how nimble these ugly wearers of tattered gas masks really were. No sooner had he picked up his rifle lying nearby than the snark halved the distance between them with one leap, and jumped onto the bonnet of the tractor with the other. Rusty springs creaked and the cowl crumpled, making Kalter think for a moment that the old Belarus was about to fall over on its side. But luckily the tractor survived, only to be dented by a jumper or two. 
Despite the skinny appearance of the snark, he weighed no less than a hundredweight, and he was probably as angry as a pack of pseudo-pogs. The Major grabbed his rifle, but the cunning monster had not jumped on the tractor for nothing. The snork had evidently anticipated being shot at, and must have had some experience in combat. He could not hit the beast on the tractor from underneath, so he would have to get out of his way. But which side was safer? 
The Intruder would be able to shoot back on all four sides, but not at such a lightning quick adversary. It was extremely difficult to change one's firing position when one was lying in a confined space, so the Major switched the safety of the IMC to fire in bursts and decided to be ahead of the enemy. Rolling out into the gap between the axles, Kalter raised his rifle, intending to put a dozen bullets into the snorkel sitting on the bonnet. But as it turned out, the snark had already left his position and jumped off the Belarus onto the ground. And while the intruder aimed at the rainy sky, the mutant managed to duck under the tractor in a second, grabbed Kalter by the scruff of the neck and tugged him back - to where the man was constrained in his movements. In addition, the VIC got caught in the tractor's footrest with its strap and pulled out of the Major's hands, nearly breaking his fingers. 
Kalter made no attempt to retrieve the lost weapon. Dragged by the snorkel like a sack of potatoes, the major drew a light double-edged dagger from the sheath he wore on his left forearm. When the creature had dragged its prey from the bottom on the opposite side, the intruder twisted and plunged the blade into his adversary's thigh. Then, with force, he flattened the mutant's thigh as if he'd sliced through an enormous courgette. 
Blood, thick and smelly with pus and blood, stained Kalter's hands, but the snark had no fear. "He really feels no pain," the intruder noted cursorily, then stabbed the mutant several more times in the crotch and lower abdomen. Again to no avail. A human would be dead in seconds from such wounds. But the snark didn't seem at risk of death from exsanguination, for it was kept alive by otherworldly forces unknown to science. 
Perhaps if Kalter had deftly severed the monster's sinews, it would have been immobilized eventually. But the intruder had no way of getting his dagger into the hellish jumper's fluttering ankles. Neither was he able to grasp them, because they were covered in sticky treasure and constantly slipped out of the Major's grasp. So he grasped at what he could - a corrugated gas-mask hose, dangling in front of his face. The same trunk that many over-impressed stalkers see in a snark... 
Intruder did not cut off the mutant's oxygen, since he doubted that the creature breathes air at all. Instead, Kalter ripped at the hose and ripped the gas mask from the muzzle of the humanoid monster. The rotted rubber snapped and the mask, snapping in half, was reduced to useless scraps. Major did it without thinking - he just got into a frenzy, or subconsciously remembered the desire to find out what exactly hide under the masks of "shy" snorkels. But in any case, this counterattack of the intruder was much more effective than the useless stabbing of mutant flesh. 
Like most predators, the snark preferred to hunt without making a sound. But when the kicking victim forced him to look at the world not through the gas mask glass, but directly, the creature roared in a way that compared to its roar the roar of a tiger would have sounded simply pathetic. As it turned out, the enemy was not prepared to fight "with open visor. Snork tossed the Major aside and covered his face with his pockmarked, but quite human, palms. It was hard to believe, but the snork really was "complexed" about his appearance, after all, hadn't the pale daylight blinded him after all? Especially since today's rainy weather was not at all conducive to that. 
Roaring at the top of his voice and still hiding his ugly face from his prey, the snark began to move quickly back in the direction from which he had come. But Kalter had no intention of letting the mutant go, and especially not now that he'd wrested the advantage from it. Not because the Major was frenzied and eager to kill the enemy at any cost. To spare the snark would be a strategic mistake, one the Intruder had no right to make. Who knows what the intelligent creature will get into its head after the snark escapes and finds himself a new gas mask. And what if the mutant would set out to hunt down the offender and avenge the humiliation when Calter had safely forgotten about it? No, he would not have such a sword of Damocles looming over his head. The Major had other things on his mind, and he didn't want a vengeful monster hanging over his head. 
Springing to his feet, Calter leaped upon the snark, grabbed it by the scruff of its hair, and with a powerful blow sliced the hunchbacked monster's throat down to the spine. Then he threw his arms around the enemy's head and snapped it sideways with such force that the mutant's neck cartilage snapped and burst. Without releasing his grip, the intruder plunged to the ground and executed a classic wrestling coup, dragging his foe down with him. The jerk, intensified by the fall, severed the snark's already nearly severed head completely. So when Kalter completed the hold, the agonizing monster's body was left lying to the right of the Major, and the head thrown aside to the left. 
It had been a long time since Calter had seen his hands shake with excitement. For the umpteenth time this morning, the Zone showed how much the Major had underestimated it. He had thought that a trip abroad was a real job for a misanthrope, but here, practically in his own country, everything would go without problems, in the style of "came, saw, conquered"? No way! If even Cordon had nearly killed the skilled intruder, what would happen when he went deeper into the real wilderness? And Coulter would not only have to adapt to the local realities in the shortest possible time, he would also have to complete a mission for the Ministry. No, the Strategist had definitely miscalculated this time, and this mission would prove far more difficult than his clever departmental analysts had assured him. 
But this is no time to lament about it. Time to get away from the field of fleeting battle, before the stalkers in the booth figured out what's what. Kalter picked up his rifle and crawled away from the area, taking advantage of the pathway of the snork, so the movement of the grass would not betray the crawling intruder. And the strange wind blowing at the back of his neck seemed to mockingly laugh at him, dragging the low, leaden clouds across the sky, hinting to Kalter that he might never again enjoy the sun... 
- Did you see it?! No, tell me, did you see it?! - The overexcited Sanek Brynza kept talking, pointing his gun at the place where there had just been a fight or some other abnormal shit. Who and why made a stir in the dry grass behind the bus stop, stalkers did not see clearly. They reached the side of the road with their guns drawn, just as the passions playing out in the ditch seemed to have died down. 
- I saw it, I saw it! - snapped at him, aiming his gun at the same place where his friend was pointing. - And enough of yelling, or now all the pseudo-villains will gush over here! - Then he turned to the third, most senior member of their newly born stalker alliance: - Kesha, and you catch anything? 
- Nope," Kesha, nicknamed Woodcutter, eloquently muttered. Kesha, nicknamed Woodcutter, added under his breath: "But I heard it. Seems the dogs near the tractor pawed at somebody. But not a stalker, that's for sure. Did you hear that thing howling? 
- Shall we go and have a look? - Putlaty uncertainly suggested. 
- You must be out of your mind! - Brynza took the initiative partner in the hostility. - What if these mutants are still there, in the grass, hiding? Just waiting for us! And in general, it is for nothing that we refused the patrol. I told you we'd better get to the roadblock with the soldiers! 
- Why the fuck did you come to the Zone, then, if you're frightened of every rustle? - Lesnovoz contemptuously threw him a glancing look. Then he waved his hand towards "Belarus": - Come on, Kolyan, let us check out the situation. You heard what the sergeant said? Lives somewhere near the Amber Lake, a scientist who buys dog tails, wild boar hooves and eyes pseudo-flesh for the price of good artifacts. Let's go see if there's really anything in there for him. Just keep your eyes open, all right? 
Holding their pistols ready, Kolyan and Kesha began to descend slowly into the ditch. Sanek hesitated fearfully but preferred to join his friends. Trying to walk quietly, the trio reached the tractor and started to look around cautiously. They quickly spotted the matted grass and the decapitated body, and the stalkers surrounded the wreckage, still aiming for it. What else could it be? If local tales are to be believed, a reanimated dead man is not uncommon in the Zone. So where is the guarantee that this stiff won't jump up and attack gullible stalkers? 
- Mother of God, how much blood, how much blood! - Brynza squeaked, wiping his boot, soiled in blood of monster, on a grass. - And we silly fellows, we have missed such a fight! 
- Guys, but it's a snork! - Woodcutter whistled in surprise. - I'll vouch for that! He's lying there with his head, and over there is a torn gas mask! 
- Bloody hell! - Quarked Patlaty, who also identified one of the zone's most odious mutants by its telltale signs. - And they say that there are no snorkels at Cordon! So it all turns out to be a lie? 
- So it must be true," said Kesha, glancing around to see if there was another one lurking about. - I've got another thing on my mind: what the hell kind of monster ripped our snark and his gas mask open, and where the hell did it go? 
- A bloodsucker? - Kolyan tentatively suggested. 
The woodcutter shook his head, he doubted, as something bigger and more toothy had certainly been here. 
Nobody else suggested other theories. The company fell into dismal silence; only the rustle of the wind in the shriveled grass, barking of a pack of dogs behind the woods, crackling of a nearby electrical anomaly and the sound of raindrops on the rusty cabin of "Belarus" could be heard. 
- Men, and this ... - first broke the silence cowardly Brynza. - Well, well, I wanted to ask, does anybody know what to cut off from snark on sale? He's got no tail, no horns, no hooves... I don't think he's got any eyes, either. 
- I'll whisper to you later, Brynza, in private, what idiots like you usually cut off a snark, and where they stuff it afterwards," grinned Kesha crookedly. - Meantime I'll tell you this: We've got the wrong guns. We've got to look for something more powerful than these cheap cannons. Much more powerful... .</text>

	<text>Two short but furious fights ended almost simultaneously. The body of the machine gunner cut down by Kalter rolled down the stairs at the moment when a shaped grenade, fired by the already dead Corsair, exploded on the construction site below. And while the sectarians who had killed him were still wondering about the fate of their brethren upstairs, Kalter and Mrakobes could see the unenviable fate of their partner as soon as the shooting had ceased. 
He was unlikely to outmaneuver ten opponents in such a short time. The best he could do was to hold his fire until his partners got out of the building. But the barrage of fire had ceased, and there were puffs of dust streaming in the wind from the windows of the two-story building. Everything indicated that the cover could be safely forgotten. No matter how many of the monoliths had survived, they would soon all be arriving at the site of the failed exchange. Dutymen and intruders had to urgently dump the halyards they had brought with them and descend along the windowless southern wall of the block of flats. 
However, only Kalter and Mrakobes could make an urgent retreat. Bulba, who had been shot by a machine gun, was in a bad way. He could not even move about by himself, let alone perform aerial tricks. The man who got hit by the bullets was bleeding, and as soon as the confusion on the platform died down Mrakobes rushed to his wounded comrade to give him first aid. 
A glance was all it took for Kalter to realize that Bulba would be lucky if he survived his wounds to dinner. There was no telling whether there was a qualified surgeon in the Bar, or how quickly the legendary Zona aesthetician, the Swamp Doctor, could arrive there on call. But now half the Wildlands lay between Bulba and the only place that could help him, and at the foot of the building there were an unknown number of sectarian survivors. Mrakobes and Kalter had little chance of surviving, no chance of caring for the wounded man. If it had been him, the intruder would have swallowed an ampoule of cyanide, but Bulba, though on the verge of death, was clearly not thinking of suicide. Neither was Gloomy going to put his friend out of his misery. On the contrary, he began hastily injecting him with morphine and applying hemostatic tourniquets of everything in sight. 
The Major ripped the mask and helmet from the sectarian he'd first killed, held his head up by the hair, wiped the blood-soaked face of the dead man, and called out to the Mrakobs who was fumbling with the wounded man: 
- Is that Guron? 
The Dutybender briefly stepped away from his troubles, peered intently at his dead foe, and shook his head as he answered: 
- 'No. Not him, clearly. That one looked like an Indian, and our dead man had a face like that actor from the Russian soap opera... A blond one... ah, what the fuck does it matter! We fucked up Guron, it's clear enough! Either he's down there somewhere, or he didn't come to the Wildlands at all! Go help Bulba stop the blood while those assholes are still at the entrance! 
- Bulba's a dead man and you can see it," Kal'ter broke off. - 'Leave him and let us go down, or it will be too late in a minute. We've got to get away. The sect will think they were tricked by the mercenaries, that's all. You get me to the War Depot, and tonight we'll right our wrong. 
- I am not leaving here without Bulba! - The Grim Reaper has resisted. - He must be taken to the base. There's a good doctor there who can help him! And you will help me and Bulba! 
- I have no time for this," the Intruder cut out his halfmask, taking the rifle and the flak jacket he had hidden behind the pillar. - I have to be at the War Depot tonight. And so are you! You have orders to kill Guron. And your mission isn't finished yet. 
- Fuck you and your orders! - The debtor exploded. - My friend is dying, don't you understand?! I'm going to get him to the Bar, with or without your help. 
- I'll go to the Stockyards, you do as you like," Kal'ter told him before turning to walk down the stairs. - But in that case, I have no concern for your Guron. The contract is terminated. 
- Go to hell! - Plunderer snarls, and wraps another tourniquet around his bleeding comrade. - Bulba is my best friend, and if we have to die together then so be it! And you are nobody to me, and I don't give a damn about you, understand?! 
Kalter didn't answer. He was already on his way down the stairs and was listening to what was going on at the construction site. Apparently the sectarians intended to sweep the building. From outside he could hear short, broken commands being thrown around by the enemies approaching the entrance. It was dangerous to run below, as the Major did not know what forces he would have to face on the ground floor. Jumping out the window was not the best option either. For a quarter of a century piles of construction debris had accumulated under the walls of the high-rise, jumping onto which from the first floor window the intruder risked breaking his legs. There was only one way out: to use a climbing winch. The major did so by hooking the carabiner on the ledge on the window sill and jumping out into the window opening on the northern wall of the building. 
It took the trained climber Calter only seconds to get down and out of the rope, but he did not succeed in escaping unnoticed. When the major touched the ground with his boots, the monoliths just burst into the ground floor. But having noticed some movement in the windows, they immediately realized what it was all about and rushed out. 
The sectarians were obviously aware that the mercenaries did not want to be trapped and, as soon as they realized that their plan had been compromised, they grabbed the most valuable artifacts and made their way out of the building by the escape ropes. Although the sectarians were noticeably thinning the ranks, they were still determined to pursue the fugitives, who were also certain to have suffered considerable losses. At least one panderer was now lying decapitated on a pile of broken bricks at the edge of the building site. 
Like a cat stalked by a pack of dogs, the intruder took the familiar route from the high-rise to the corner of the boardwalk warehouse, and huddled behind an overturned dumpster, pausing for a moment to calculate what forces were pursuing him. 
Six or seven enemies, half of them dressed in exoskeletons... No one knows how many of them are gauss, but we must assume that the major is in the range of four electromagnetic guns (it was so - the "gauss" killed by Corsair sectarian picked up one of his surviving brothers). How many monoliths remained in the building was anyone's guess, but in any case, the Grave Digger now had to contend with a much smaller enemy group. However, it will soon become clear by the automatic gunfire that inevitably erupts from the high-rise, when the sectarians ascend to the third floor... 
A terrible blow shook the container behind which the Major was lurking, and instantly in the side of the iron box, half a meter from Kalter, there was a huge through hole with jagged, outward edges. Then this swift thing also ripped through a transformer box a hundred yards behind Kalter and ripped through something else in the distance - all that reached the intruder was the rumble and clang of broken glass. Without thinking twice, the Major rushed around the corner of the warehouse, and then it began what can only be compared to a raging tornado - a rare occurrence even for a zone rich in all sorts of cataclysms. 
Much more powerful blow followed the first one, tossing the container like a matchbox, smashing to pieces the transformer and making a big hole in the end face of the railway tanker, which was stuck to the rails. After that the tin-plated boardwalled warehouse, along the wall of which the major was running, began to literally tear itself apart. This violent process of destruction was accompanied by a succession of methodical sounds, like the whistling of an enormous whip, and a resounding bang on the tin. No explosions were heard either inside or outside the warehouse. Nevertheless, the structure stretched across the site and began to break apart systematically from one end to the other, like a long bundle of New Year's Eve firecrackers. 
Throwing a fleeting glance over his shoulder, Kalter was horrified to find that not only was the warehouse behind him turning into a chaotic heap of slate, tin and planks. A freight train, frozen on a nearby track, had suffered the same fate. The whistling and rumbling hurricane tore wooden wagons to pieces, leaving only bare platforms, which perhaps only a nuclear blast could have moved. 
It did not take long to figure out what the elements were responsible for all this trouble. The four Gauss cannons came barreling back and forth one by one, giving Kalter no respite. The sectarians were clearly not going to bother with a long chase through the Wildlands. They had no choice but to raze the area first, then take their time searching through the rubble for the fleeing body. The scrupulousness with which the Gaussians had approached the task was frightening. They unsparingly fired sector after sector, forcing the intruder in one direction, forward and only forward. Behind Kalter there was a whirlwind of debris, as Gauss fire turned everything in its path. Ahead of him stood a brick wall which served either as the boundary of the marshalling yard or merely as a separation barrier between its vast sections. 
He could break through the wall if he wanted to, especially since he was already running for his life. But a wire fence on top of the fence would not allow the intruder to leap over the wall in one dash. The fugitive was caught between the impregnable barrier and the advancing chaos, in which it seemed that not even a fly could have survived. The hoardings and wagons vanished like houses of cards in a gust of wind, while fragment after fragment of "Gauss" blew them away, not allowing this storm to abate for a moment. The Major saw that it would overtake him when he reached the fence. And then, even if Kalter dodged a lightning bolt, the debris from the blast would bury the man under a brick mound that would take half a day to clear. Though for a carrier of an exoskeleton such work would be hardly burdensome, and any of "armored men" could dig a runaway from under ruins without even straining. 
That was the main advantage of Gauss guns. Initial velocity of their shells allowed to hit the target at long distance and not every cover could resist their penetration power. Now the enemy was firing special blunt-edged projectiles at Kalter, which had a decreased penetration in favor of damage control. Upon hitting an obstacle, the projectile not only pierced it, but also tore it apart; hitting a metal surface, on the other hand, left huge tearing holes. Due to the flying debris the area of Gaussov's hit increased many times. With four electromagnetic cannons firing at once, the sectarians stood no chance of survival. 
There seemed to be no foreseeable area in the world in which they could defend the Major from the all-penetrating projectiles. Except for one single shelter: the steep edge of the unloading platform where Kalter was currently fleeing. The platform had been built at the level of wagons to facilitate unloading of trains. A gangway was not required to get inside the wagon - the train came to the edge of the concrete dock at a short distance. There was only a narrow gap between them, and one could only squeeze through it after taking off one's stalker gear. 
He had no time to undress, but did not need to. Having reached the last and penultimate carriage, the intruder jumped through a wide gap between them. After that he fell down on the sleepers, crawled under the wheelset and froze, covered with a multi-ton iron structure. 
And in a second a barrage of Gauss fire swept over the Major's head, sweeping away the remains of the warehouse and in the blink of an eye the boardwagon as if it had been glued together from cardboard. Dirt, nails and splinters fell on Calter from above, but the coarse debris was unable to fly through the gaps in the platform. Boards, fragments of wagon frames and sheets of broken slate and bent tin sheets that had been flown in formed impassable rubble on the tracks. To make matters worse, shells that had hit the fence were sprinkled with brick fragments and fragments of barbed wire... Although the area of the station looked more or less civilized, it was now falling under the category of the "Wilderness". 
Had Kalter been certain his enemies would limit themselves to shelling, he would have lain beneath the ruined wagon for at least a few more hours before venturing out into the light. But it is unlikely that the sectarians would consider the fugitive mercenary dead without concrete evidence. "The Gaussians would certainly not go over their own rubble, but the armadillos would certainly not hesitate to go back and forth over it to make sure they hadn't wasted enough ammunition. 
Getting out from under the wagon was not so easy. In fact, the Major was now at the bottom of a large pile of bulky debris. He had to crawl down the sleepers to the end of the wagon before he could find a way out. The overalls protected him from cuts that would have left him with sharp splinters and torn edges of tin sheets. But all the same, it was a pain to wade through the clutter that clung to his clothes all the time. Besides, it would have created unnecessary noise and could attract the attention of enemies who were already studying the ruined ground with binoculars. 
No sound, however, other than the sound of debris crackling and creaking, came as far as Coulter noticed. Including the expectation of gunfire from the side of the multi-storey building. It was, of course, a little early to draw confident conclusions from this observation, but by all appearances all surviving sectarians had gone in pursuit of the Major. Who had apparently in turn decided that the fugitive was also the only surviving enemy. If that weren't the case, more mercenaries would probably have descended from the top floor of the high-rise. Why would one of them flee and the others stay in the building? The mercenaries are a close-knit clan and it is not customary for them to fight every man for himself. His flight was hardly a diversion either, for he evidently did not wish to be seen by the sectarians who saw him... 
Whether Calter wanted it or not, he had diverted the rest of the enemy's forces to himself, and thus aided the Mraconian in his noble quest. Whether this will save the badly wounded Bulba, however, is hard to say. Unless Mrakobes summoned help from the Bar. But even that did not guarantee that the long-suffering man, who had lost so much blood, would live to receive proper medical treatment. 
There was only one way to check whether or not the monoliths had noticed Kalter who had got out from under the rubble. Though the major himself would hardly know the result of such verification - the enemy's gaussaw would blow out the intruder's head before he would even hear the whistling of the flying projectile. However, once again under the open sky, the fugitive realized that his appearance at large did not cause a stir in the enemy camp. He himself, however, soon came into sight of Kalter. The three exoskeleton-wearing sectarians were approaching the rubble with confidence, intending to start their search any minute. Where the Gausses were at this point could not be determined. But for sure all of them had moved to more favourable positions in order to continue the observation of the nearby space and, if a dead fugitive was found, to aim the Armadillos at him at once. In case he was found alive the tactics of the Gauss had to differ from the previous one in only one way: first the fugitive had to be killed and then his coordinates had to be given to the searchers. 
The major had to get out of the rubble as soon as possible and run towards the cluster of carriages, the place from where the monoliths themselves had recently appeared. There, on the multi-track railway line, were mostly freight trains, carrying fuel and bulk cargo. Of course, the former was drained long ago, but the latter - coal, crushed stone, fertilizers and other such materials - were mostly still there in their containers. Despite all killing power of Gauss guns it was definitely impossible to shoot through a carload of crushed stone. In addition, the labyrinth of high walls, which was in fact the vast area blocked with trains, was an ideal place to cover their tracks. And it also led to the War Depot. That was where Kalter headed, once he was sure he hadn't attracted the attention of the sectarians. 
The intruder covered the first thirty meters at a snail's pace. A rampart of wagons and warehouses, built up near the unloading point, was simply impossible to bypass. Kalter had no choice but to crawl straight through the piles of debris, freezing and holding his breath every time the shaky footing shuddered and settled underfoot. 
Unlike the Major, the exoskeleton bearers moved much more confidently forward, simply kicking and scattering anything that blocked their path. Debris under their onslaught exploded as if by magic, and a squad of regular fighters was able to follow each armored man unimpeded. Kalter figured that if he and his pursuers continued at the same speed, in a couple of minutes the sectarians would cut him off from the road to the northeast. He had to press on before the situation turned from shitty to utterly shitty. Rushing towards the trains, under fire from four Gauss cannons, would be as hard as swimming out of a raging maelstrom. 
The further away Kalter went from the smashed site, the less rubble got in his way. Soon he no longer needed to scramble over the piles of rubble, as they could be safely bypassed. At the same time, however, the Major appeared more and more in the open, looming in plain sight of enemy observers. Every move Kalter made was now a toss of the lot: one never knew if a fugitive would be spotted by a Gauss, or if he would again get a lucky break. 
Of course, long flirting with a coin would sooner or later cause it to fall on the wrong side of the palm. The intruder's flirtation with his pursuers ended in the same predictable manner. True, it wasn't the Gauss that spotted Kalter first, but an Armadillo with a machine gun. After breaking through the jam and taking a good look around, the machine gunner soon found a suspicious flicker in his direction and opened fire on the target looming ahead. That was the signal for other monoliths: Gaussians quickly spotted the direction of their colleague's fire and began shooting in the same direction, while other armadillos began to advance through the mounds with double energy, anxious to join their comrades sooner rather than later. 
Retreating back was not only disadvantageous for Kalter, it was also dangerous. He had no idea how well his EMP rounds saw his target, but he knew that the faster he ran, the harder it would be for the Gauss to hit him. The nearest freight train was no more than a hundred paces away. But to get over that hundred paces and stay alive would be an absolutely unattainable result for the intruder. 
Piles of junk scattered all over the place were again in the air by shells that hit them, and right in the Major's way a reinforced concrete support crumbled at its base. Without stopping, Kalter jumped over it and immediately darted to the left. Just in time: the asphalt behind the major erupted in torn up strata, as if a small meteorite had crashed into it. The ominous whistling of the unseen scourers began again to cut the air and stimulate the adrenaline rush of their would-be victim. 
The zigzagging target continued to be fired until one of the Gausses slammed a projectile into an Electra that happened to be in Calter's path. It was an order of magnitude larger than any of its sisters the Intruder had already encountered in the Zone. The anomaly had the size of a small tree, spreading out its tentacle-like lightning bolts. The Major was not bothered by it, as it was away from his route. The monoliths' shooter couldn't have hit the Electra by accident. It follows that he shot at it in such a way that the anomaly would hit the fugitive with an electrical storm. 
Once again the Zone has once again proved that to make any predictions about it - an exercise in futility and fraught with trouble for those who dare to rely on these predictions. Even Kalter, whose time in the Zone did not exceed a week, it was obvious that the anomaly pulsating to his right was not as simple as it might at first seem. There was something atypical, if not cautionary, about its appearance. And the size of the enormous Electra had nothing to do with it, although it was also suggestive. The mystery was as unexplainable as the sensations the Major was getting from the alien wind. 
The gauss fired into the anomaly was thinking in practical terms, but the tactics he had devised were of no avail. Pierced by a projectile, the lightning-fast - literally - anomaly did not unleash an electrical storm as he had expected. Instead, the shimmering "tree" suddenly swelled into a tumbleweed the height of a good Mongolfier. The enormous sphere, composed entirely of an intricate array of pulsating lightning, bounced like a ball, then leaped just as wildly (in relation to the mongolfier, of course) to where the projectile had struck it. 
"The Gauss shot at the fugitive a couple more times, destroying the cab of the nearest electric locomotive and demolishing the roof of a wooden teplushka booth. But then it was not Kalter who became the sectarians' priority target, but the strange Electra. Suddenly the anomaly, which came to life, diverted the attention of the monoliths, all the more so when it rolled towards them. The whistle of the Gauss cannons did not stop, but now all four shooters were exclusively hitting the electric sphere, wanting to "defuse" the anomaly before it jumped to its attackers. 
Kalter had just reached the last wagon in the long coal train and threw himself under the protection of the eighty-tonne giant, as if a man jumped out of a heated steam room and into a snowdrift. Not yet knowing what was happening behind his back, the major expected that the enemy shells were about to start digging into the train's side. But, contrary to such predictions, the wagon continued to stand still, as it had for many years before. This was doubly surprising, as the rattling of the air with the "gauss" shots did not subside even for a moment. Intrigued, the intruder peered out from behind the massive wheel, eager to find out what had happened. 
The tumbleweed, made of lightning, was approaching the rubble, which Kalter had difficulty getting out of. When they saw the danger, the three pursuers decided not to tempt fate. They halted the pursuit and made the Electra give way to the wild, furious Electra, ducking and running. They did not risk to shoot at her. But the Gauss didn't spare any firepower in their attempt to destroy the fearsome orb that held no promise for the Monoliths. They seemed unconcerned about what would happen if it exploded in the vicinity of their huddled brothers. 
"The Armadillos acted extremely wisely, preferring war with the tumbleweed to playing hide-and-seek with it. "The Elektra passed the non-aggressive sectarians as if they didn't exist. The anomaly was only interested in the stalkers who kept spearing it with steel projectiles. Which, however, did not pierce through the sphere and did not cause a disturbance in it, but simply disappeared into bundles of lightning, either melting into it, or even sinking somewhere in another dimension. 
The Gaussians finally figured out why the anomaly had not touched those closest to it, but had gone straight to those in the distance. But the unlocking of this secret dawned on the gunners too late. Each of them got a curse on his head as soon as he fired his first projectile into the electric sphere. After that, it was no longer possible to rectify the situation, nor was it possible to get rid of the Electra. Even if it still had the rudiments of a primitive mind, but it is unlikely that the monster was capable of mercy - a quality foreign to all creatures of the Zone. 
In the final moments before the electric predator struck back, there was no more firing at it. "The Gaussians abandoned their positions and tried to flee from the curse that had overtaken them. Naturally, they failed - the punishment came to all four of the inconsiderate sectarians. The anomaly soared over the unloading pad, first morphing from a balloon into a huge, flat circle, which then curved into a translucent dome and covered an area the size of a stadium. 
The imposing anomalous structure lasted only a few seconds. But during that time, a lightning storm so monstrous that when Elektra reincarnated into a sphere, all that was left of its rampage was a gigantic scorched expanse. There was nothing to be seen, not even charred heads. Smoke, too, had vanished without trace-as if the anomaly had sucked it in, like a hood. Only flakes of gray ash hovered in the air; for some reason the Electra refused to dispose of them. All of them were immediately carried away by a gust of wind which prevented them from falling on a circle as flat and black as a freshly ploughed field - the place from where just a moment ago four monoliths were firing at Kalter. The disturbed Electra, then, hovering above the fire, seemed to enjoy the results of their vengeance. 
Calter did not care how long it lasted. The enemy wanted to use the power of the Zone against him, but the Zone, however, had no desire to be of service to the sectarians, even though they were guarding its main artifact, the Grantor of Wishes. An odd choice... Though not exactly unexpected. After all, it wasn't the Major who awakened the giant anomaly, but his pursuers. Therefore, they had to reap the benefits of their own shortsightedness. 
Pausing to catch his breath, Kalter jumped up from the rubble embankment and, with one last glance back, jogged along the train to the northeast. Intuition told the Major that the three surviving armadillos would not get away from him that easily. Even if they abandoned their intention of getting even with the fugitive, they still had to leave the Wildlands by the same road. The Intruder had no intention of engaging them, let them go. Surely one of them had already contacted his superiors at the War Weapons Depot to report the outcome of this false deal. So there was no point in eliminating surviving enemies. But there was a risk that by attacking the Armadillos, Kalter would be wounded or killed and therefore fail the mission. 
To complicate matters further, Guron - unless, of course, he had died today incognito in the Wildlands - would order the helicopter and the Huron-D to be diverted back to its original position for safety reasons. But that probably won't happen. It would be too risky to chase the captured Mi-24, now invaluable to the Monolith, over the Zone. Kalter was certain that until the sect decided to strike at the Sky Spider, the helicopter would not leave its hangar at the War Depot. From there the target was practically a five-minute flight away. Whereas, returning to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Guron had all chances to run into the army aviation loitering over the Zone. Therefore it was much easier for him to strengthen the outpost protection, than to relocate the SAM to another location. 
How quickly Guron would move additional forces to the depots, Kalter did not know. But he supposed it wouldn't happen for the next ten to twelve hours. In theory, the intruder should have reached the Monolith base before reinforcements from Pripyat. Here the Major didn't lie to Mrakobes at all: with the penetration to the enemy outpost it was better not to hesitate. The advantageous time period for this was limited and shrinking with each passing hour. And since Mrakobes preferred the execution of Voronin's order to save his comrade, it means that the intruder will carry out this operation without the support of Dutya. The General has ordered that not only will Kalter be given backup, but also plastic explosives and ammunition. Plus two days' worth of packed food, which the Duty guest did not refuse either. The unsupported intruder was nevertheless in possession of all he needed to complete the suddenly complicated task. A Misanthrope in enemy territory could do without everything else... .</text>

	<text>To the Chief of Special Operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colonel... 
    ...based on investigation N 3231-1/7. In connection with the revealed circumstances: develop a list of rules for commanders of military stalker groups, including paragraph nineteen. The request for confirmation of the liquidation code is encrypted by the group commander with a personal key. The response is duplicated to the group commander... 
    
    The commander slowly rolled onto his back, Davydov was transferring his gun to Zakhar. 
    I was already sitting on my right heel, my left leg bent at the knee, and in my sight, in the hologram circle, I could see the figure of the grouse and flashes from the flame-thrower of his M4. 
    Bullets slammed into the stump. My shots toppled the figure looming in the scope. 
    Big unloaded his sniper's magazine in the direction of Davydov, but he managed to hide behind a tree. 
    Several more barrels struck our group. Falling behind the stump, I looked around, still not understanding anything, but mechanically noting: the position was bad, we were too close, disturbing each other, the enemy pressed against the ground and the trees, not allowing a good fight. The enemy! I never thought I would call special forces that. What the hell is going on?! Why are they shooting at us? Not a single sane thought in my head, not a clue... 
    The queue crossed the stump, I cringed, then moved sharply to the left, bringing the barrel out to the side, shot through the dense grass and immediately recoiled. I should retreat, but where to? The glade we had come to was about three kilometres from the swamps, with an area full of anomalies backing up behind us. If we turn southeast and move away from the clearing for about a kilometre - judging by the map, we will get to an abandoned military unit. 
    And there is also a third group. What will they do, who will they shoot at? Dutyo did not have to wait for an answer - to the south, on my left hand, rumbled. Bullets were flying at us from the edge of the clearing. A cheerful card of fire was emerging! Wedge, firebag, we were now only way back to the anomalies. 
    Labus had a good position, he was lying in a recess between two pines growing in the shape of the letter V. The roots had eroded there, nature itself had created a mini trench. Comfortably seated, Kostya fired at the fighters attacking us. Bullets, flying from the south, landed in a pine tree to his left, Labus did not pay attention to them, though he could not fire back. But Kostya's Davydovs were holding well, but they were still approaching us, though slowly thanks to Labus's fire. Short runs, from tree to tree - soon they would come to throw grenades. 
    Zakhar was wounded, Davydov still managed to shoot him. From this position I saw that the communicator was sitting, leaning against a thick trunk. He was tightening the tourniquet on his right arm - he gripped one end with his teeth and with his left was winding the rubber band round and round over his jacket. Zakhar looked at me, reached into his waistcoat and pulled out a grenade. 
    There was a shallow ravine further on, and Marat was lurking in it. He was hard to hit there, but he was barely able to fire either, risking a bullet right in the head as soon as he looked out. 
    I did not see Aydar, and Big was in front, behind a snag, the men of the third group keeping him out. The frown was behind him, closest to the far edge of the clearing, his machine gun working in short bursts. This was the line of defence, shaped more like a cross. The only one I could not see was Small - where was he? 
    The handheld communicators were down, something in the area was preventing them from working, maybe the proximity of the anomalous field. I had to shout a command: 
 - "Back up the ledge, in a serpentine fashion, pull back! Heading eastwards, along the edge of the clearing! 
    A big risk, but I did not want to go back into the anomalies. 
    Labus duplicated the command, Marat followed him. The gloomy one did not respond, and I suddenly realized that his machine gun had been silent for a few seconds. 
    Immediately I saw the fighters of the third group far to the left - they were running across the clearing at an angle, firing in the process, a white dog dashed between them in long leaps. Marat was the closest to them, but could not stick out, lying there, turning his eyes, surely aware that he was approaching the gruzhniki, a little more and the end. They'd flank us now, me second to Maratha, not an easy man to hide behind a stump... I turned round to cut them off with a burst, but other people's shots rang out frequently and I had to press myself to the ground with my head down. It was like being caught in an air mincer. Space shuddered, clattered, bullets pierced through it - left, right, above me - a nearby thud, they pounded into the stump, ripping out splinters. 
    The fighters converged on us from both sides, squeezing as if with pliers. My shoulder burned, a bullet flew tangentially, tore the sleeve of my jacket. I could have swallowed it all up. I stood up and raised my rifle. The bullets squealed, the stump shuddered with the blows. I aimed my rifle at the spetsnaz soldiers running through the clearing, but the first of them flailed his arms and fell. 
    There was a dry sound of gunfire - someone had opened fire from the eastern, far end of the clearing. The second fighter went down and then the shooter hit something no one had noticed before - a transparent cloud of hot air hovering low above the ground. The third group should have run past them, but when shots rang out from the east, they spun, jerking their barrels from side to side, searching for the shooter, and ended up dangerously close to the anomaly. 
    The roast went off. The fire struck upwards, a concentric wave of incandescent air rolled in, ducking the grass - it went black, shooting smoke jets. Three of the fighters were thrown in different directions, two were blazing torches, the third's back was shot up. Bullets mowed down those set on fire by the anomaly, and the fountain of fire shrank and went out. The survivors lay low, we could not see them - the grass never caught fire - but there was smoke over the edge of the clearing, making observation difficult. 
    A white dog with a scorched ass crawled out from somewhere on the side and darted towards the ravine, barking frantically. Marat jumped to his knees. Aidar jumped out of the bushes at his side and darted to his master's rescue. The white beast leaped, its jaws open, its fangs almost digging into Marat's neck, when the blade of its army knife gleamed in the air. Marat extended his arm forward, gripping the thick fur on the dog's chest; the other struck from beneath. The dog finished himself off as the blade sliced into its belly, leaping through it. There was a shrill shriek, a snout hitting Maratha's shoulder, and he turned and flung the dog further behind the ravine. A moment later the snarling Aydar was beside him. Wrapping his arms around his torso, Marat dropped back down. 
    When the roast went off and the gunfire subsided for a while, Labus was able to stick out further from behind the pine tree. Davydov's men jumped up to attack us, pinned to the ground by the crossfire. Realising too late that the third group had been shelled by someone, they were hit by Kostya's machine gun. 
    The big one, who ran over from a snag to a squat oak tree, peeked out from behind the trunk and took out one of the grouse with an accurate shot. Zakhar, tightening the wound on his arm, threw a grenade. It exploded, one of Davydov's men fell down, someone shouted - and in that second the general flow of battle intangibly changed, as if the scales had swung. Now the tactical advantage had shifted to our side, we began to win time. 
    Big ran back, Zakhar on the contrary forward, we found ourselves on one line. Kostya shouted: 
 - Cover! 
    I reloaded my rifle. Holding the muzzle above the mangled stump, I fired a burst over the ground. Labus, ducking, rushed to the stretcher, lifted the scientist on his shoulder and hurried to the eastern border of the clearing. Behind him, clutching a healthy hand weapon, now and then looking around, ran Zakhar. 
    Kostya fell down, threw the scientist, turned around and lifted the machine gun. Immediately Zakhar sank down beside him on one knee. 
 - Go! - Shouted Big. 
    Clutching my rifle to my chest, I rushed towards them, so as not to block the line of fire. Aydar's barking sounded from the side as he sprang out of the ravine and raced on a parallel course. A shot rang out from behind, a second, a bullet zigzagged over his shoulder; Zakhar's rifle rattled frequently, Minimi clattered. At the edge of sight flashed the figure of a running Marat. Zahar's magazine emptied, and soon Labus's machine gun went silent as well, but I had already fallen between them, flipped over my shoulder, jumped to my knees. The barrel of the M4 turned towards the enemy. 
 - Go!!! - I shouted to the whole clearing. 
    This is what a snake with a ledge is all about. The big one ran towards us, I saw movement far behind him, a blurred outline emerged in the panorama of the sight - the helmet of the fighter sprawled in the grass - shot, the helmet twitched and disappeared. Marat crouched down beside him, taking aim, Aydar hid behind his back and barked angrily. Zakhar reloaded and started shooting, Labus swearing nearby, something jammed in his machine gun. He, who had settled on the eastern edge of the clearing, fired frequently at the fighters of the third group, not allowing them to stick out of the smouldering grass. 
    The big one got close, turned around, crouched down. 
 - Let's go! 
 - Leha, come on! - LaBus shouted. - Zakhar! 
    We rushed on, and immediately Minimi spoke from behind. 
    I saw Khmury near a fallen tree, the barrel of his machine gun was raised and slightly smoking. He was lying face down in the grass with a bullet hole in the back of his helmet - a sniper's job, assholes! I clenched my teeth so hard my jaw clenched. If I get my hands on who gave the order, I'll shoot them dead on sight! Who would make our commandos work for their own?! 
    Beyond the edge of the clearing we ran in a long arc. The big one covered the retreat. 
    As I expected, the shooter who stopped the spetsnaz was Maloy. He was not confused when he heard gunfire in the forest, guessed what was happening and took a risk: he walked around the clearing along the eastern side, which would be about two hundred metres, and came back - just in time. 
 - Where is the commander? - he asked on the run. 
 - Killed," I said without looking at him. - So is the scowl. Zakhar is wounded in an arm. What's ahead? 
    The second number of the sniper pair reported: 
 - The edge of the clearing is clear. On the left, two hundred meters, it's a kisel, and ahead, a hundred, it's a merry-go-round. Farther ahead there's thickets. There is no way through them now, no time to wade through. If we go to the kissel, we'll see the animal trail, I think, wild boars made a footstep on it. There are no fresh tracks, but animals definitely walk on it. 
    That's all we need is local wild boars. If animals use the trail, though, and there are no anomalies there, that's not bad. Most likely, it will lead us to military unit or to some other object in the Zone. Maybe to the abandoned village, the permanent camp of one of the groups or the ruins of the collective farm... Any buildings are a shelter for us, which the group desperately needs right now. 
 - Marat! 
 - ß! - The scout responded. 
 - Let's go to the head with Aydar. Zakhar, how are you? 
 - Nothing, I can go. 
 - Labus? 
 - We pant, - easily answered Kostya. I couldn't notice, that body of scientist on his shoulder somehow bent him to the ground. 
 - Don't slow down," I said. 
    Sitting down, I put my hand into the side pocket of my rucksack, took out a roll of steel wire, pulled the ephemera from the waistcoat. 
    The others ran on. Big, who had overtaken me, stopped too, said: 
 - "Let me help you. 
    He was breathing hard, whistling. The big one fit his nickname well: plump, tall, quiet. In general, he and Zakhar looked a little alike - not in appearance, but in demeanor. 
 - Here, - I handed the grenade to the sniper and shoved the end of uncoiled wire. I jumped over the path and looped it round the trunk of a young aspen, nodded to Big. 
 - Stretch a centimetre," he said. 
    I loosened the noose on the tree, let out a short section of wire, and tightened it again. 
 - And I left a surprise for them there," Big grinned angrily. - Such a macrame I wove... They'll take one, but the other two will catch on! Lech, what's this nastiness? Why so? The commander, Karl, then Gloomy - three of ours, eh?! 
 - Later, Big, - I answered through sheer force. - We'll talk about all this later, now let's get out of here. 
 - Done, - he said, when he had finished fiddling with a grenade. 
    We covered the efka and the loop with moss and fallen leaves. I could not hear the pursuers, they were professionals, but I could sense they were close by and closing in fast. 
    Having finished with the stretching, we started to catch up with the group. Within thirty seconds an explosion rumbled behind them - the Grushers had hit a stretch of the Big One. It gave us five minutes extra - now they will walk slowly, peering into the bushes and trees in front of them. If I only knew how many of them were left... I reckoned one down myself, two or three up by the Kid, one down by the Big One. Total: minus four, maybe five. Three caught fire in the anomaly, two of them were definitely killed by Maloy... And there were eighteen Grushers, so that would make twelve or even eleven, plus one dog. Six of us and a cargo of three hundred. They'll catch up with us in ten minutes. You can't run in the Zone, it's not that kind of territory. 
    We ran on in the old order, rustling the leaves, looking round every now and then. I remembered, once chased a stalker to the Agroprom, and he managed to hide somewhere in the basements. Led him about a kilometre through the Zone, dogs were not then part of the patrol groups. And stalker, zarazka, lucky - it happened, one of the corridors closed anomaly. We almost went there, clearly read the trace, showing that the fugitive had gone there. The Zone, in spite of him, smelled ozone in time, and then the detector confirmed: a roundabout ahead. In general, we have survived the consequences for another twenty-four hours. Mutants then as if furious - different way they are affected by blowout, the Zone is unpredictable. Outside somehow no one wanted to stick out. Later, when we went back, we looked - an anomaly in the corridor had shifted, crawled away to the wall. We checked the corridor, and there was a dead end and a can of stewed meat lying empty. The writing on the wall is made in coal: Hemul was here. So the stalker, then, was trapped, and when he managed to get out - he decided to make fun of his persecutors in the end. Lucky for him that we had to wait in a hole like marmots, he got away from us, the lucky one. 
    So that's it. Hence the moral: luck in the Zone first thing, it is even more important than all sorts of skills. They won't save us now, because people with the same skills are chasing us, and there are twice as many of them. And we need a lot of luck. 
    We were deep into the woods when I realised the group was following the trail that Mali had mentioned. It was a real animal trail - wide, the ground well treaded by hooves and paws, the bushes broken at the edges. Probably animals often run along it, but we would like to know why exactly here, where from and where to? 
    We had walked about half a kilometre when the forest thinned out and there was a wide gap between the trees ahead. 
    Soon we were at the edge of a clearing with two masts of high-voltage line towering above it on widely spaced legs. Scraps of wire swayed in the wind, bunches of rusty hair fluttered. The smell of ozone. 
 - Oh you... - Zakhar said. - What is that about him? 
    The others were silent, staring at the clearing. The glade was overgrown with tall grass, unnaturally green and dense for this time of year. It is late autumn all around, all forest is yellow-red, and it is the end of spring here! Labus muttered something and spat - he did not like this kind of incomprehension of the Zone, they pissed him off. 
 - The detector is off the scale," Marat said nervously. - Too much electricity in the air. 
 - Can we make it across? - I asked, looking up at the path across the once-cleared stretch of forest. - It's a long one, I don't know how much of a detour it is. 
 - I don't know, I've got a solid spot on my detector. Maybe Aydar can walk us through it... 
    The dog was visibly nervous, too. 
 - Big, move back, you'll be back when I whistle," I commanded. 
    The sniper disappeared behind the trees. 
    The scientist hung motionless on Kosti's shoulder, the latter did not lower it into the grass, only hunched over to make it easier to hold the weight of his body. 
 - Aydar, look for it. We need a passage, Aydar. - Marat patted the dog's scruff and unhooked the leash. 
    Aydar tried to go to the path at first, but changed his mind and skittered along the edge of the clearing. We stood and waited, shifting from foot to foot. The spetsnaz were on our trail, the advantage we had gained was fading with every second. 
    At last the dog stopped, stretched his head as if trying to see something on the other side, and leaped to the base of the mast - one, two, in long leaps. Above the lush grass only a grey head flashed. He ran between the poles of the mast, reached the edge of the forest on the other side without incident, turned and wagged his tail. 
 - Come on, follow the trail! - I commanded. - Marat, Maloy, Labus followed me, then Zakhar, Bolshoy guarded from behind. 
    Let's run. The glade must be crossed as quickly as possible, we are very good targets for arrows in the forest. If, while we're here, the pursuers reach the border and open fire, hiding behind the trees... Best not to think about it. 
    I whistled for Big to come towards us. 
 - Halt!" shouted the Small and grabbed Marat by the rucksack. 
    I heard Aydar whimpering, his tongue hanging out. The dog kept staring at his master, but did not dare to approach him without a command. 
    Marat stood still with his leg raised, leaning far back. Maloy was holding onto his rucksack, which otherwise would have sent Marathon tumbling to his back. The shadow of the mast covered them, wires swayed above their heads, one often struck a long tongue of rusty hair, an unpleasant creaking sound reached his ears. 
 - What's out there? - I asked quietly. 
 - I think we have a problem," Maloy answered without turning around. - Look upwards. 
    I peered upward and realized that a cloud was hanging almost directly in front of my head as if it had been threaded on a pole. It resembled that phenomenon that I had seen near the electric arc near the helicopter, like the air trembling on a hot day over a heated roof or the asphalt. What was it? A new kind of anomaly? Without turning my head, I glanced around. A gentle breeze lapped the grass in waves, and nothing else around me moved. The pursuers were getting closer; to be stuck in the middle of this clearing was certain death. I looked at the anomaly again. It was swirling at head height. Aydar skipped beneath it calmly, while we idiots were watching him and didn't notice the danger. 
 - Maloy, put Marat on his back. Marat, relax. Big one, what's in the back? 
 - Clear so far, commander,'' that word, commander, cut me a little... ...and I'm sure the others did too. After all, not so long ago it was a way of addressing another man. And not just any man - our friend. Who was no longer alive, and we hadn't even been able to bury him properly. Now I was in charge of the group, though I did not want to be. 
    While Maloy was dealing with Marat, Labus controlled the forest in front, and Zakhar, myself and Big looked in the opposite direction. At last came a whisper from the Maloy: 
 - OK, let's keep going. Only on the crawl. 
    I turned - Marat was crawling to the opposite edge of the forest, between the long legs of the mast, diverging from the trunk at a forty-five degree angle. Maloy squatted down, preparing to follow him. In principle, the effect of the anomaly could extend all the way to the ground, so I held up my hand, indicating to the others: stand still. So Marat had become a lockpick for us-we'd deliberately let him risk his life for us. But there was no other way out, either he put himself in danger, or we would all end up under the bullets of the pursuers. Marat was not a novice on whom we had studied the seriousness of the threat, he was our equal and simply found himself ahead of everyone else. Had I been there, I would have crawled in his place. 
    He stood up when the mast with the shivering cloud was left behind. I realized only now that I hadn't breathed for half a minute or so-and I was relieved. I was all right! I put my hand up to indicate to the others that I could follow, and hissed at Little's back: 
 - Come on! 
    Aydar wagged his tail: his master had escaped! He tried to lick it, but got a slap on the nose for blowing the anomaly. 
    When Maloy had passed the mast I looked back at Labus. And I remembered: he has a scientist. It is necessary somehow to drag the wounded man under this cloud... I ordered: 
 - Kostya, drag the legs, and I will pull him under shoulders. 
    Labus got down on all fours and put the load of three hundred in the grass. I lay down in front. 
 - Well?" he asked. 
 - One, two ... come on. 
    We started to drag the body under the anomaly. One, two, three! - I repeated, and we jerked it further. When we approached the mast a humming sound was heard. We covered another metre - it became louder, heavier. The grass around us went in tiny ripples, like ripples on water. Heaviness came upon him, a throbbing in the back of my head. 
 - Labus, crawl," I said hoarsely. - Don't stop... 
 - I am crawling, I am crawling," he responded. 
    We were under the pillar, which seemed to rise up to the sky, furrowing the low floating clouds. The hum intensified, and our breathing became labored. 
 - Come on! Come on! - I kept repeating as hard as I could. 
    And we could have gone sideways, crossed the glade in a curve, bypassed the air anomaly... But for some reason Aydar didn't want to go another way through a strange grass, he ran almost directly. It means that something is wrong with the glade, some other dangers we cannot see. And now, since Marat and Maloy were already unharmed, it was unlikely to strike down. 
    The rumble began to fade, the heaviness lessened. Time passed slowly, it seemed to me - it took fifteen minutes to drag the scientist, but the chronometer showed that only two minutes had passed. The norm of transporting a wounded man to the battlefield, Labus and I more than exceeded it. 
    Marat and Maloy were waiting for us by the trees, guns drawn, watching to see if anyone would show up on the other side. Once out to the edge of the forest, I immediately sent Marat ahead on the path and myself with Maloy began to cover Zakhar and Big crawling towards us. Labus, meanwhile, dragged the scientist to the nearest tree and laid him under it. The trees near the high-voltage line looked even more bizarre than the one where the helicopter had fallen, the trunks twisted in spirals - some thick, squat, others long and narrow. It is good if this forest is passable at all. When I served in the regiment scouts for the first time I went out into the field, I understood very well what forests and what driftwood we had. I understood too, what it means to fight through forest not like some Indian, with a knife in his hand and a bow on his back, but with the equipment and weapons on. Although then normal, ordinary territories were, in the Zone, mutated plants sometimes create even impassable obstacles. Trees often emit poisonous sap, stems of some species of grass can cut even the dense synthetic fabric of the waistcoat or uniform. There are many legends among the stalkers, including the fact that there are ogre trees in the Zone, but I've never met any, and no one on Yantar knows anything about it either. Probably just another tale. Although about the strange anomaly called the dummy tree - heard a few times, and from people I trust. 
    He was already crawling under the anomaly when, on the other side, figures flickered at the very edge of the clearing. 
 - Faster! - I hissed. - This way, come on! 
    Big jumped up when he reached us, and then we were off into the woods. 
 - In that order! - I commanded on the run. 
    Maratha's figure loomed up ahead. Shots rang out from behind us as we entered the trees. The roughnecks had sprung out onto a clearing, and we had left them a very good marker for passing through it, having ploughed a wide path in the grass. It was as if we had marked the route on the map with a red dotted line. 
    I hoped that they let the second dog go ahead, she will skip ahead along the path, like our Aydar, and the men after will run into the anomaly. That'll buy us time... But Davydov is an experienced commander, what if he notices that we crawled under the mast? Though he may not realize it in the heat of the moment, they're not just walking there, they're in a hurry, chasing us. I wonder who commands the third group? Nikolaev or Bobrov? It had better be Nikolaev, he's new in the Zone, less than a year, not much experience, in addition, there are rumors - someone's prot?g?. If he's the one who's following us with his group, he'd better not try to tear his ass to pieces, why would he try so hard? But if it's Bobrov, then it's much worse. The Beavers have been together for two years now, they've only had two losses in that time - professionals, damn them all! How did they convince them to hunt their own? Orders, of course. It can`t be a mistake, if the code for liquidation arrived, Davydov should have sent a request, and the OKa should have confirmed it... And the Special Forces had drunk more than one can of alcohol with us, we had insured each other more than once when carrying out joint missions ... 
    My musings were interrupted by a clap, like the explosion of an attack grenade. And at once there was a shout from behind. Aha - they were in trouble! It would take them a while to find a new trail, or crawl up an old one - if that was at all possible after the anomaly had first gone off - for us to get to some sort of cover. 
    I wonder what that cloud was hanging from the mast after all. How did it work, what happened in the clearing now? I'll have to make a description later in the report... What report?! - I shouted at myself. What are you talking about? You were betrayed by the command, your former comrades set on you! How can we even be, because we are already as good as dead, our lives are not worth a penny if the OCa decided to merge us. That's it, you're finished, Resort, understand? You won't go on holiday, you won't see your mother and sister, and you won't get out of the Zone at all; you will be killed here, and that's all. Because what are you going to do now? To the stalkers? That is how they took you in - you, former military man. And OKa, and they are enemies for you now. 
    And yet I could not believe that there was no way out. In the back of my mind there was a thought: a mistake, a misunderstanding, the main thing was to make everything clear, to contact the command, to explain something... 
    Mutant bones began to show up on the road, piled around the path and on it. What the hell was that? Soon the path ended, and Marat and Maliy, who had gone ahead, were waiting for us. 
 - What's the matter? - I asked, running towards us. 
    Aydar was sitting quietly with his tongue out. The instruments were clear. 
    Marat pointed to the clearing ahead and Maloy commented: 
 - The left-hand side of the pines, like an arch, see? 
    I looked closer, even shifted my glasses on my helmet. Aha, there it was, far ahead: a squat caponier with a narrow embrasure, overgrown with moss. So... So we approached the farm of the military unit. But what do these bones lying all over the place mean? 
 - What thoughts? - I asked. 
    The boy pushed back the collar of his jacket and scratched his neck. 
 - No, not yet. Bones all... I guess someone was feasting here. 
    Marat added: 
 - And this caponier isn't pleasing at all. 
 - Do you think somebody's been settled here? - I asked sceptically. 
 - We don't think anything, Commander, decide," replied Maloy. 
    I glanced around, looked at the caponier again. The concrete thing was an evidently defensive fortification, as they called it in army regulations and orders. Just what we need, in principle. There may be some passageways, possibly leading to a military unit... But that's not certain. What if somebody sits inside and shoots mutants, running along the path, like in a shooting gallery? Then we shouldn't go there, of course. Anyway, the bunker seemed to be deserted and if the impression was right - there was no better shelter for the group. 
 - Marat, what is there on the right? 
    Marat had a good, powerful detector with a long range. He glanced at the tablet, frowning. 
 - You can't go to the right, there's something not very clear. I'm seeing a band of electromagnetic fields, and the temperature is off the scale here and there... like anomalies, but for some reason they're all hovering on the same front. We start looking for a passageway, we lose our time advantage, even with Aydar. 
 - On the left? 
 - Three hundred metres clear, and then the same thing. 
 - Left, then. Run! 
    Marat after my command let Aydar go ahead and he galloped ahead of us. Soon a very interesting sight was revealed: a lot of broken young trees as if a giant had mowed them down. The older, stronger ones survived, but the trunks were deeply chipped. I stopped, staring. The whole thing gave me an unpleasant thought - no way the boars were rubbing against the trees like that. What kind of beasts had done this here? Or was it an anomaly of some kind? 
    I liked this place less and less, but two groups of Special Forces were gaining on us, and there was no other way. 
    Marat, running ahead, gave a sign to stop, Aydar crouched down, waiting for a command. Marat waved and went on, much slower now. Kostya, still dragging the scientist, was breathing heavily, and I decided that it was time to order Big to take the scientist. 
    Just time to look back at Labus, there was a click to the right. Everyone froze, barrels turned to the source of the sound. I saw a foxhole, overgrown with tall grass around the edges - its parapet seemed to me at first to be a long bump covered with bushes. The foxhole was about five metres away from us, with Marat standing closest to it. Moving slightly to the side, I could see part of the far wall, poured with cracked concrete. Not a bad hiding place. Reminds me of a gap, like one built for the troops to wait out a bombardment... 
    There was a slight buzzing sound, like the work of servos. Immediately over the caponier came out of a hidden hatch the barrels in the pair. They stood upright, but dropped with a clang into their swivel-mounted grips as soon as the platform that had lifted them was locked in place. 
    Maloy exhaled: 
 - SWACK! 
    That's right - it was a pair of SVAKs, an air cannon. Its twenty-millimetre shells had shot down more than a dozen German planes during the Great Patriotic War - but how had it ended up here, in our time? I did not have time to think about it, there was a characteristic clanking sound, which could not be confused with anything else - the tape drawing. In my army youth I had heard enough of them in the turret of a fighting vehicle for a lifetime... 
 - Atas! - Shouted the Maloy and Marat jumped to a trench. 
 - Big, Labus, follow me! - shouted I. 
    All rushed to the shelter. The dimensions of the trench was not so good, about three by one and a half meters, but the depth was almost a full height. The men pressed their fingers against one another, banging their helmets with their butts, one on top of the other. From the outside we must have looked as if we had all decided to crawl into the same tub to bathe at the same time, with our clothes and gear on. 
    As Big plopped down on the wounded Zakhar moaning in pain, there was a rumbling sound from above. 
    The rate of fire of this fool was about eight hundred rounds a minute. Such guns had been placed on defensive turrets along the line of fortifications during the Second World War. How many shells are there in its belt? I couldn't remember, but it looks like a lot. 
    Surely boars come here to feed - and maybe they're not the only ones. Just sit back and wait for the SWACs to fire on some of the animals. Mutilated bones scattered around are better than any bait - a mutated creature walks along a path expecting a fast meal, runs into a movement sensor and gets under fire of an automatic unit. Projectiles of such a gun would tear anybody to pieces - so much the better for predator. Pieces of meat are spread around like on a silver platter, and all they have time to be picked up and dragged to the trail to be devoured. And new creatures would soon appear on the trail, or some of their kind would get in the way carelessly, the pack would not be shy about that either. 
    The whole place shuddered, lumps of earth rolling on the concrete. Somebody was twitching under me, somebody's elbow pressed into my back between my shoulder blades, and I was twitching too, pushing somebody with my elbows and knees, and the space was vibrating, the clatter of gunfire filling it as if we were inside a drum being pounded at full speed by a crazy drummer. 
    The shots stopped as suddenly as they had started. My ears were ringing and my eyes were blurred in faint circles. I asked hoarsely: 
 - "Is everyone alive? 
 - I think so," Labus murmured from the side and underneath. - Don't crush me the scientist! Why did I have to drag him all the way up here? He's already skinny, and you moose big... 
    Marat was the worst off, he was at the very bottom. Aydar was pinned to the wall, the dog was hanging between the bottom of the trench and Zakhar, whimpering. 
 - Big... - I started, but he had already understood what had to be done. Took off his helmet, put it on the barrel of his rifle and lifted it up. 
    Silence. 
 - We're in the blind spot of the gun," he said. - Shall I look out, Commander? 
 - Take your time," I paused. - Better release Aydar, help us to climb up. 
    In some stages we pushed the dog on the surface and Big carefully poked his head out of the trench. 
 - Now... Go that way," the sniper waved several times to Aydar, pointing in that direction. 
    The dog shifted from paw to paw, tried to stick his muzzle back into the trench, sprinkled the earth on us from the parapet. Labus arched his head and tried to say something and some lumps got in his mouth. Kostya got furious and promised to arrange an execution for our four-legged friend by mop-up. Aydar got scared and trotted off in the direction of the turret. Everyone held their breath. Fifteen seconds passed and we heard a calling bark. Big looked out of the trench again, took a closer look and crawled out onto the parapet. Zakhar followed him, I helped Labus to lift the scholar, then Maloy and Marat got out. 
    Nobody risked to rise on their feet, so we crept to the guns. They looked around - quickly found the hatch covered with branches. Just when Bolshoy was about to pull the lever, there was a sound of servos. We froze, Big quacked, Maloy swore, Aydar yelped briefly. The cannon set wiggled its barrels from side to side, jerked them upright, and then drove back underground. The locks of the armor plates slid shut above them. 
    A sigh of relief went out from everyone. 
    They panted, hoping the doors would not be locked from the inside as a grenade would have been too difficult to penetrate, and there was not much plastic left. 
    Big took hold of the lever again and said: 
 - Well, Godspeed. 
    He pulled it. There was a rattle, the lever turned. The sniper pulled the hatch toward him, and it creaked to the ground. 
    I stepped closer, peered in. It was dark below. The big one looked at me, his example was followed by the others. I hesitated. 
    Finally Labus said: 
 - Well, commander? The spets must be very close, decide. 
 - Down, - I said. - Kid, you go first. Exercise extreme caution. 
    The quick, nimble Maloy was better suited than the others to go in front of everybody on such a long run. He slipped past Big, drew a torch from his waistcoat, and disappeared into a well with braces in the concrete wall.</text>

	<text>Bear's group disappeared somewhere near Chernobyl. And after all they were well equipped, took trunks, stocks and equipment, and besides all seven - guys shabby, in the Zone not the first year. But they disappeared along with the Medved himself, who was considered almost the best stalker on this side of the Pripyat.
- Check again," I said. - Sure there are two signals coming?
We were lying in the bushes on a slope, with ruins, a ramshackle one-storey house and a water tower below. Beyond was Chernobyl, and beyond was the wide expanse of the Pripyat River. The city stood on a steep bank. The opposite, flat, was overgrown with lush greenery in summer, but now everything there is brown, red and yellow-red: fallen leaves, earth, and bare trees. Small rivers that start from the Pripyat River turn blue. Sandy, Rachya, Starik, Kamyshovaya... It is a pity the barge is not seen from here. It is a good barge there, big, powerful - I heard they have started to use it instead of a ferry before the second accident, when it was necessary to transport heavy-ton trucks, parts of tower cranes and armored cars across the river.
Fistful, my partner, pulled back his sleeve again. I can't stand lugging a PDA around on my wrist, because a handheld computer incorporated into a local positioning system is obviously much bigger and heavier than a normal watch.
It irritates me, and I always feel like something is clinging to my wrist, so I almost always carry the PDA in my backpack pocket.
My partner turned on the map, took a closer look at the small rectangular screen and said:
- Right, two down. And the motion sensor is silent. Right there they are, Chemist, under that hill. Why can't you see them?
Why indeed? There's no one at the bottom of the hill. And the silence is like a morgue at night: deaf and dead. I stood up and swung my binoculars from side to side. A water tower, almost a whole one-storey house, trees, ruins, an old military truck, sagging on the left side... They used to transport soldiers in such trucks, but I have not seen them in motion lately, at any rate. Maybe it still works, maybe there's even petrol in the tank? Though no, I don't think so...
I'd better have a smoke. I was about to unbutton the flap of my breast pocket, but at the last moment I changed my mind. No, later, the situation is too uncertain. A cigarette should be smoked slowly, with pleasure, after some important business has been finished - and now it has just begun.
- Well, Chemist? - Priggishny asked. - How was it? And then his gaze caught something unusual in the grass. More precisely,
For the Zone - just usual, or rather, accustomed.
- 'Right, I see one,' I said. - To the right of the tower. The clothes on him are dark green, so it's hard to see. I paused in my binoculars and looked up, looking away from the tower.
I peeled my binoculars back and glanced at Thorny. He nodded indifferently.
- Wrong, a dead man, then? Well, yes, that's what the markings show...
Two still red marks appeared on our PDA screens about fifteen minutes ago, as we were already approaching the hill. The area of Chernobyl is one of the nastiest, stalkers don't like to wander in here, because the computers work horribly here. There is an impression that the whole area is covered with some anomaly, fundamentally different from others: it seems harmless for people, but disrupts electronic systems and mutes communication. It is not always easy to understand what the computer shows, the colour of the mark that marks a higher organism like a man may change from green to red and back again, as if the carrier of PDA is constantly dying and then reviving, or it suddenly goes out and appears again in a minute, but already a kilometre away ...
- But it's not the Bear, that's for sure," the partner said. - It's just a signal, without any of that... stuff.
I nodded. Smoker, our regular fence, supplied Bear with equipment for the expedition and paired seven of his guys. For that, Bear had promised half the loot. But the Smoker didn't trust the stalker enough to let him go so easily, even if his boys would accompany the Bear. The gear, the weapons, the supplies, all cost money. After all, Bear, after getting out of that mess with the zombies-a large group, he said, had attacked him in the middle of Chernobyl-was crawling to the bar in only his trousers and a torn T-shirt, all wound up... the girls who worked in the bar were helping him out, and that cost money, too: food, medicine, bandages. Now it turned out that even the clothes that Bear had worn on the job belonged to the fence. In general, the Smoker was interested in the expedition's return, firstly, and secondly, with the loot. He had not only invested a great deal of money, but there was a very large profit to be made. After all, the Bear was going to find not something, but a field of artifacts, which in the Zone has long been rumored. He swore that he had seen it when he escaped the zombies, and that the field was somewhere there, near Pripyat, and he would find it again, for sure...
Smoker, of course, grabbed the bull by the horns and haggled over half of Bear's expected payoff, though the stalker had initially offered only ten percent. Prigorishny and I were on another case, so we didn't go with them. Artifacts are my specialty, and I would have gone with the Bear as a companion, having turned down one of the Smoker's men, and my partner would have followed me, where would he have gone? By the time we were in the bar, the miser had already worn himself out: the Bear does not get in touch, his boys, too, go, Chemical and Bottom, find them, I trust you, you are one to beat, experienced, will pass where these seven have not passed ... And how he moaned, how grieved when I said that less than half of his half we are not moving anywhere. Then he began to swear, called us bad words, but - nothing to do, gave up.
According to a conservative estimate, the loot from the field of artifacts could be sold for a quarter of a million, so the PDA, which Smoker gave the Bear personally, secretly from the stalker was added a special chip, a beacon, which introduced in the tag additional harmonic. The usual PDA doesn't tell those around it who its owner is, only signals that someone is nearby, plus, if the owner is killed, it sends a corresponding pulse. But now the Bear's computer could tell it was him.
We didn't see any signals from his PDA, though. But we did see the other two...
He took off his cowboy hat and turned over on his back to stare into the low autumn sky. His partner was white-haired and had a scar on his forehead from a badly treated wound, with six reddish dots - traces of staples.
- Well? - He asked again, but I didn't respond. He was young, and therefore fidgety, overly energetic. In the Zone, you have to know when to be on the move, shooting at will, and when to be petrified and not breathe, watching those around you. This is just the second case: is there someone there, in the ruins, or not? In the fucking ruins?
- One dead body, two signals. So look for the second one.
I nodded. The motion sensor was silent, and I didn't see anyone moving down there either. I should get up and go down at last, but something was holding me back.
- Come on, Chemist. I'm sick of lying here.
- You're such a fidget, aren't you? - I grumbled in anger. - Oh, be quiet a minute, I'm making a reconnaissance.
- What?" he said, raising his head. - What are you reconnoitering?
I grimaced at the answer. He was clearly lacking in education. The Zone has made me a simpler thinker, and my speech has changed, coarsened. But still, I'm, so to speak, intelligent, studied at the chemistry department, and my partner immediately after school in the army, where he got into paratroopers. He was trained there, of course. He even went to hot spots, he said. Since then his skills haven't disappeared and more than once saved our lives.
We should go, it seems calm. But why are there two signals and one body? I don't understand...
What the hell is that? I got up on my knees, and so sharply that Priggishny worried.
- What? What is it, Chemist?
There was a man hanging from the tower with his back to a height of a foot and a half. I would not have been so surprised if a crowbar, say, had been sticking out of his belly, with which some strongman had pierced both his body and the brickwork, but no, he was just hanging there like an insect stuck to a flycatcher on a chandelier.
Lowering the binoculars, I glanced up at Fist. He was already kneeling beside me, leaning forward with his head bowed and his butt on his shoulder. The barrel moved smoothly from side to side. His partner was not an ordinary weapon, but the whole "assault rifle-grenade launcher system" called "Groza", which could be turned into an assault rifle, carbine, and grenade launcher, and from one to another - with the help of a simple switch. On the left side of his arm hung a compact "Cypress", albeit with a broken laser pointer, and on the belt on the right - "Beretta".
- What is it? - He asked tensely, not lowering the Thunderbolt.
- There's a man on the turret," I explained.
- Ah! - Peckerwood exhaled after a pause. - I see. He's a dead man, isn't he?
- Yes it is," I agreed. - A dead man, though.
- Yuck! You said: "Hanging." I thought he was hanging on something, but he was... What was he pinned with, I can't make out?
He put his gun down and sat with his legs tucked up. He looked at me questioningly. Dead bodies are commonplace in the Zone, no surprise there. I understood why my partner was in such a hurry: not only because of his natural fidgetiness, but also because he ought to look around before dark, and get out of here quickly.
-' All right, all right," I said. - Fuck it, let's go.
He jumped up at once. I got up, too; we started down, careful not to take our eyes off the house, the ruins, and the tower. It wasn't as badly damaged as the buildings beside it; the roof was only torn off, you could see the broken beams. But it's almost intact, and the doors are closed, maybe even locked.
- Why are you so jumpy all the way? Taking a few more steps, I answered:
- This case is rotten.
- Why all of a sudden? People are in trouble, we need to help... And earn a little...
"Slightly"... We expected to make a hundred thousand on this operation, if everything goes well. By my and my partner's standards, that's a lot of money, we never saw it in our lives. Enough for the "all-terrain armoured vehicle," which Prigorshnya had long dreamed of, and more would be left.
- So what's rotten? - he repeated.
We walked slowly, guns raised. Still nothing moved at the base of the hill, no movement at all.
- Why on earth would Bear come to the bar, not from the Chernobyl side, but from the Dump? - I asked.
- Well, he must have wandered off... He could hardly stand on his feet, and he was not thinking straight because of the poison in his rusty hair.
- Lost... Well, why didn't you ask yourself why Bear couldn't remember where the field of artifacts was located?
- I do. So did the Smoking Man. He told me he asked Bear.
- Oh, yeah? Smoker's a shrewd man... What did Smoker say?
- He said he was half-crazy when he left the zombies, for they had managed to beat Bear, and he got into a thicket of rusty hair, and they bit him. The girls at the bar told me he was really red in the face, covered in rashes and blisters. That's not counting the wounds and abrasions. He was in a lot of pain for the first few days, then he just got over it.
We went down to the middle of the slope. I was of medium height, but Prigorishny was almost a head taller than me, so he could see better. But I didn't see any danger either. A flat meadow below, the remains of barns, a tower with a lodge and a truck. That was it. And no trouble at all. But when we were two-thirds of the way to the target, I felt a sudden prickling sensation, like invisible fingers with long claws going over my body, from top to bottom. I nearly screamed.
- What's up?" whispered Priggishny, when I came to a halt, pointing the rifle blindly in front of me.
- Don't yell! - I nearly shouted. - There's something there.
- Oh, come on. There's nothing there.
He took the binoculars off my belt without asking for permission, and looked round.
- Aye, it's empty," said Priggit after a while.
I have a lot of bags on my belt, and two special containers, a larger and a smaller one. While I took out a nut with a piece of bandage on it, binoculars raised higher: my partner was looking over the Chernobyl houses at Pripyat.
- Barge is standing, - he muttered. - Explain to me, Andryukha, what she stands there?
Prigorshnya - the only one in the Zone, who knows my real name: Andrew Nechaev. Ivan Pistol knew before, and Vitya Crazy Fist, buyers from the very first who settled here. But they've been gone for a long time, one of them shot himself, and the other went mad.
- "Halt, silence," I said and tossed the nut to the foot of the tower. And then, to the left, a second, and then a third, but to the right, in the direction of the motionless body in the grass.
No, there was nothing there. The nuts had fallen normally, and the trajectory was the same for all of them. So what's the matter? I even squatted down, because I felt nauseous, my insides twisted. And I was shivering, and my fingers were trembling.
- What's the matter, Chemist? - Prigorchnya asked, at last assuming gravity. - Does it really hurts? But it's empty, I tell you! Dead bodies, are they? Smoker's got a skeleton hanging under the chandelier in the bar. That's no indicator.
I straightened cautiously, keeping my eyes on the area below. There were times when my premonitions deceived me. Or was I getting sick? I had caught a cold, wandering through the autumn forest and crawling on my belly on bare ground... Still, I stomped in one place, still glancing around, until my partner pleaded:
- Look, Chemist, we'll be down like this for three days. How long is that going to take? We'd have found that Bear or that field by now, we'd be sitting at the Smoker's stash drinking vodka...
Of course, he's got it wrong: we'd have had a long walk to the bar, and we wouldn't have made it to the bar in time for tomorrow morning. Not to mention the fact that where the Bear - in general is still not clear, we may be two days here to look for him. But perhaps I am too cautious. I've got to go, especially since I don't feel nauseous or chills anymore. I said:
- You know, I don't believe in any artifact fields.
- How? What do you mean, you don't believe in it? - He got worried.
- There aren't any, they're probably just legends, you know? Any such... such place, - I waved my hand, - like the Zone, - quickly acquires legends and superstitions of all sorts. Because our life depends not only on our skill and caution, but also on our luck. Hence all sorts of fairy tales about the field of artefacts, masters of the Zone, the Black Stalker, the Monolith...
- Monolith is not a fairy tale," he protested resentfully. - You say that too. What, you think the Doctor is a fairy tale too? And the Hosts of the Zone, they are!
- Of course he's not a fairy tale, he's cured enough people. I've even seen him once. But the rest... Ah, well, what's the point of arguing with you, you ignoramus!
The truck was backwards to us, backwards to the wreckage. Green awning, green cab. The paint was peeling, cracked and rust-stained, the driver's door ajar. We walked past, peering inside just in case. No one, obviously, though I wouldn't have been surprised to find a zombie or just a skeleton driver in a cap and holster on his side, clutching the steering wheel with his bony fingers. But there were human bones and two skulls, one crumpled, almost crushed, near the front wheel.
Even the birds weren't chirping and the flies weren't buzzing. When we reached the tower we examined the dangling body.
- Coyote," said Priggishny.
It was indeed him - a skinny redheaded stalker with a freckled face. He hung like Pinocchio in Carabas Barabas's room, head slumped across his chest, limbs hanging limply. His face was contorted, as if something had frightened Coyote just before he died... frightened him to death. A PDA was visible on his right wrist, and there was a wet puddle on the ground beneath his body. Nikita stepped closer, gingerly grabbed his boot and pulled.
And instantly bounced back: with a muffled clang, Coyote detached himself from the masonry and collapsed beneath the tower.
His partner grunted and spat into the grass. The dead man's back was streaming like butter on heat - something glistening and gurgling there, jerking softly...
We quickly backed away from the body, because as soon as it fell, a peculiarly sweet smell began to spread around.
- Have you ever seen such a thing before? - Nikita asked in a whisper for some reason.
I shook my head:
- No. But tissues shouldn't decompose like that, it's nonsense.
Still backing up, we walked past the closed door of the building and only then turned our backs to the dead man. I hardly knew Coyote; I'd met him a few times at the Smoking Man's - a stalker as a stalker, an ordinary vagabond in the Zone. But I still felt uncomfortable, uneasy. There was a man - and gone, and died a horrible death, judging by the distorted face. His PDA would keep beeping until it had run out of power, and then the mark would go out after the man's life.
- I don't want to look at the other one now," my partner admitted.
We went to the second body, though, and stared at it in silence. There was no telling whether the deceased was as terrified as Coyote before he died. For his face, like his whole body, was either gnawed away or half-dissolved in some kind of acid. His skin was peeling away in shreds, and the scraps of cloth were mingled with his flesh as if they had been mingled with it. His belt and buckle, as if they had just been polished, his boots, his holster, and the PDA on his wrist, which looked like a red-brown stick, were intact.
- Do you recognise him? - Priggishny asked.
- No.
- Probably one of the Smoking Man's guys, too. I'll go inside and have a look.
He ducked a little and went to the one-story house. His partner's movements had changed, had become supple, composed and measured. His army booted feet touched the ground noiselessly - you wouldn't believe the big man could move like that. "Nikita hung his Thunderbolt behind his back, took out his Cypress and held it out in front of him, clutching it with both hands. I've got only "pam" in my holster, and "kalash" as well, I've got to get something tougher at last... This "Groza" is still a good weapon. And expensive, but I did not spare the money, because now I feel safe with my partner. Well, relatively, as safe as possible in the Zone.
He paused in front of the ajar door, listening, then pushed it open with his trunk, crouched down, swinging forward. He glanced at me, waved, and disappeared inside. I waited, stepping away from the corpse, studying the ruins and the truck.
Fist appeared soon after, Cypress hanging under his arm, his long arms swaying relaxedly along his body. He smiled at the edge of his lips. Good, if that. As he walked toward me, I lowered the barrel and squatted down. Despite his fidgeting, he was the best partner I could find. We've been walking around the Zone for over a year now, and we've become friends, and our friendship is of the kind where I can rely on him and he can rely on me for everything. I know he's got my back. He knows I won't cheat, I'll share the profits fraternally. He's the shooter, and I'm... I'm the chemist. No, I can shoot, too, of course, but I ain't much of a fighter, really. I have other virtues, thank the Black Stalker.
- Eye there," he said as he passed. - That's all I got. I'm afraid to go near it. You go ahead, I'll look around a bit more.
He walked around the tower, rustling the grass.
And I asked after him in confusion:
-Oko?
He did not turn around - must be pleased with the effect produced.
An eye! A rare thing. And very expensive. But I will not sell it anyway, it will be useful for other things... Stop. Don't share the hide of an undiscovered artifact, it's bad luck.
I entered the house. This must have been some kind of watchman's house. Like a lighthouse keeper, only this one kept an eye on the water tower. I'm sure there's no one around now: the place is wild and untamed, and only zombies and controllers can get around on their own. The room was empty, with only the wreckage of a chair and a rusted bucket in the corner. There were still bits of wallpaper on the walls, and the plaster on the ceiling was all crumbled and shingles were visible.
In the middle of the room, about a meter above the floor, hung a faded green-blue oval about the size of a fist, the shape indeed slightly resembling an eye. It was translucent, dense in the centre and thin around the edges, so that the opposite wall was translucent through it. I walked around it, almost touching it, and then I was able to see through the opposite wall. I walked around it, almost touching the walls with my shoulder. The Geiger counter was silent. The air shook slightly, and the artifact was surrounded by a ball of barely perceptible flicker, in which occasional sparks danced. I squinted and squatted down. The downy cloud that enveloped the eye had a foot, like a giant dandelion sprouting from the floor.
As I approached the artifact, I heard a barely perceptible buzzing - not even a buzzing, but a buzzing, like a whistling with a subtle rattling. He took the container from his belt, stepped closer, then even closer, and finally was right beside the eye. It was hovering at waist height, and I bent down to peer into the centre. I saw there, quite clearly, a picture: a dugout surrounded by dense thickets, a campfire nearby, a man in a camouflage jacket squatting in front of it. Two short horns, an iron bar, a kettle... The stranger was stirring a stick in it. I could see it all from a height of three metres. The head suddenly rose, turned sharply to the left, to the right, and then the man stared upwards, directly at me, so that I even recoiled, recognizing Chemul, a well-known stalker in our area. Hemul recoiled, too, and fell on his back, kicking his legs and snagging his bowler. I couldn't make out the rest, but I think one end of the rod twisted out of the slingshot, and the pot tumbled into the fire. There was no sound; the picture inside the artefact faded, as if it had been blanketed in gray steam. The last thing I saw was Hemul peeking out from the side with a gun, shooting into the sky. I recoiled; for a moment I thought he was going to shoot me in the forehead. But nothing happened; no bullets flew from the eye to the ceiling. But when I looked again, the image had disappeared. That's the way it is. I wonder if there was an eye hovering above him that Hemul hadn't noticed before. I had to remind him of it when we met and ask him what he had seen.
Anyway, the eye was not threatening me, and I, becoming bolder, unbuckled the latch of the container from my belt. The tight-fitting lid slid heavily in its grooves, exposing the metal gut. I slid the container under the window and lifted it so that it was inside. Holding it from underneath with one hand, I closed the lid with the other. I stepped back. The eye sailed through the wall.
Shit! I stood there, staring at it in confusion. No, it wasn't really floating, it was just hanging there all the same, or had it moved a bit? Or had it moved a little, and now it was swinging back, like a flower head on a stem. I squatted down again, stepping back a little. I squinted. There it was, the "stem." It had buckled when I shifted the container, but it was straight now. What if I used the crystal? Would it be able to cut through the stem? Yes, I suppose so, but it's expensive and rare, so why should I forfeit one artifact for the sake of another? And if the crystal and the Eye interact with each other... I have not tried to put them together, I don't know what would happen. But if you think about it, an eye is more valuable. A smoker, for instance, would pay more than half as much money for it as he would for the crystal.
I pressed my palm against the second, small container hanging from my belt, and then I remembered that the artifact we'd recently obtained near an abandoned farm, having gutted two zombies, was now in Fist's possession. Where is it, by the way, why is it so quiet outside? Worried, I stood up, backed away from the eye, feeling an irrational reluctance to turn my back on him, and walked out of the hut, raising my machine gun.
I lowered it with relief when I saw my partner, who must have managed to get around the tower in the meantime and was now trying to unlock the door. He was bent over, picking at the gap with an army knife, exchanged with a fellow soldier for a case of vodka and five tins of condensed milk, which we had got last winter from an abandoned warehouse near the Agroprom. I went to the Thorn, and meanwhile, he wiggled his blade, jerked the handle and broke something with a crunch - either a bar or the tongue of the lock. The door flew open. The handful jerked in - and screamed. 
The scream was so savage that it stunned me at first; I'd never heard a man scream like that before. My partner jerked back, slipped, fell on his back, and crawled to his feet without stopping to scream. And I was confused - frozen, instead of grabbing my machine gun and opening fire over Fistfull, into the dark doorway. Something was about to come out of there...
And then I was pierced again, stronger than on the slope: as if an invisible hand stuck in my chest, squeezed, squeezed my heart. I groaned, fell to my knees, and seemed to scream too, though I could not hear myself scream. It was coming out of the tower. 
And Prigorodny was already climbing on all fours, not looking back, and shouting, opening his mouth with a large letter Oh. When he and I were a few meters apart, I was finally able to cope with the horror, which seemed to flood my whole body. My arms were shaky, my legs buckled, but I stood up somehow, pressed my AK to my left side, opened fire. It rumbled and rattled all around. A handful suddenly found themselves quite close.
-Don't fall, it is no use! - He shouted in his ear. - Come on!
I gave up; he grabbed my shoulder, jerked me till I nearly fell, and raced off. We ran, looking back again and again, but there was no use running away; it was moving faster than that, spreading out from the tower, swelling and catching up with the terror which was surging ahead like a shockwave, filling my brain with blind panic.
- We shall not make it! - I shouted. - No, wait, where are you...
But Nikita had already jumped into the cab, pulling me behind him, rolled over to the seat beside the driver's.
- The key! There's a key...
The key was indeed sticking out of the ignition. While I was sitting down, Prigorishny turned it. The engine rumbled. So, it is running, this truck is our salvation, because it is very close, already covered a dead man in the grass and his body fluttered, foaming red, dissolving, spreading on the ground ... I shuddered, hammered on the seat, stomping my feet under the wheel, not hitting the pedals: finally hit it, jerked the gear knob and revved the throttle so that the truck sped off the spot just as it rolled up to the rear wheels. .</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_b8_doc_8">
	<text>The forester coordinated the buckshot. Carefully he put the cartridges in a casing by even columns and stuck matches between them, for sure he covered them with starch. It was a good starch, yesterday Lesnik cooked blueberry sourdough on it.
Methodically collecting cartridge after cartridge, the stalker listened. In an evening wood it was silent. A crow cawed high above the bait, a young moose carcass tied to a bough. The carcass was lying on a sloping plank at the bottom of the slope, with a sagging rope running from it to a tree, and a hole in the ground below. The sun had set, the shadows of the trees faded. Dusk was thickening. Soon the pseudopods would be out hunting.
The hut from spruce branches, Lumberjack's lodge, stood apart from the "wolf's coil", from shelter there was a good view of a steep slope and a bait. The carcass stank perceptibly, but the stalker wasn't embarrassed by it. He inserted two cartridges into the barrels, spread the rest on the shelf in front of him. Everything was ready for a successful hunt.
The woodsman ambushed them near a line he had found, risking his own neck. There was a large pack of mutants living further away, but all but the largest would be afraid to cross the boundary of the territory. How many would turn out, so brave or so hungry? Finding a place free of anomalies, he dug a hole with the expectation of a couple or three critters, just under the slope. Finished, he placed a dense palisade along the earthen walls. Knots on the stakes protruded downward to prevent the beast from getting out of the hole. Of course, the mutant was not a wolf, what is he to do with knots? But that is why the forest ranger with a trusty, double-barrelled shotgun sits here.
He carefully rubbed fat on a ramp, a carcass lying tied on it, and the bottom of the pit was covered with thorns. An animal, having smelled an elk, would climb down the steep slope and roll down the plank. Everything seemed to be in order, and even the wind was favourable, but something bothered the stalker. In the Zone you can not foresee everything, hunting - a dangerous business, but for the hides of rare spotted pseudopods with red stripes on their tails very well paid.
And money is needed. The woodsman touched his fingertips to the right side of his chest. It already hurt to hold the double-barrel at his shoulder, aiming...
It was getting dark fast. Inside the shelter strong and spicy smelled needles, fallen leaves and wet earth, under his knees rustled moss. The woodsman smoothed his dark beard with threads of gray hair, shook the old double-barrelled gun thoughtfully... And then a howl was heard in the distance - a pack was calling out before the hunt.
He got down on one knee, stuck his gun in a gap between thorny branches, and stood still, looking along the trunks. He might have sat like that for hours, waiting for game.
The flock was approaching. It swept left and right but its howls and barks melded into a whine that grew more ferocious: Pseudo-dogs had spotted the bait and were moving swiftly toward him. He pointed the gun up the hill, trigger finger tensed. The metal under his skin was already warm; Lesnik felt its pleasant warmth.
Branches rustled, a young fir-tree twitched, and beasts appeared between the trees.
Heart beat in his chest, beating fast and furious. No matter how skilled a hunter you are, adrenaline rushes into your bloodstream at the sight of prey. Stalker silently drew in the cold evening air through his nostrils.
The hill was a boundary. The first, the largest mutant stopped abruptly at the slope, paws blasting the ground. Ropes of saliva dangled from its grinning mouth, its eyes burning with hunger and fury. The scent of lying meat wafted up his nose, the carcass quite close - but out of pack territory!
"Come on! - mentally pronounced Lesnik. - Jump! Get him!"
The beast's shovel was in sight, but the stalker didn't want to spook the pack.
Next to the first pseudo-dog, a second, a third stopped... The mutants scrambled and howled in helplessness.
Then one of the young ones, unable to stop himself, slid down the hill. Claws clawing at the ground, the beast snapped its teeth, attempting to grasp its prey, but caught only air-and with a confused shriek plunged down the ramp into the hole.
The woodsman blinked. The little runt has ruined everything!
The flock stomped in place, listening to the angry shriek coming from the trap. They were frightened, for crying out loud! Not a chance for them to go near the lure now. The stalker had a good view of the mutants as they swiveled between the trees at the top of the hill. The scent of fall beckoned them, but instinct kept them from venturing beyond their territory, and their fellows fell into the middle of nowhere...
He waited a minute, then another, before he realized the hunt was over. Because of some dumb wolf cub! The woodsman stood up heavily, head butted against the brushwood, when one of the mutants jumped.
It appeared to be the leader. There was something of a wolf's habit of eating carrion on their bellies, and this was the basis of the wolf-reel trap. They dug a deep hole under the hill and suspended the carcass on a steep slope. The animal would swing over the bait to pounce on the food from its belly, and roll into the hole on the slippery, grease-rubbed plank.
The forester grinned as he saw the mutant fall through the gap between the spruce branches.
But a few more followed the leader.
The pack is small, but even that should be enough to fill the hole and crush the first beast - a large and very dear one. The stalker sprang from the hut, the double-barreled rifle drawn to his shoulder. A young pseudo-dog flew down the ramp, clawing at the ground and howling, followed by a large, lobed female. Towards them came the whimpering of two trapped mutants.
Almost without aiming, Lesnik fired from one barrel and immediately from the other, a pair of pseudo-dogs crashing down on top. Young and the female flopped into the trap. After swearing, the stalker quickly reloaded his rifle and put both charges of buckshot, which he had been laying for so long, into the chest of the savage beast. It pressed itself to the ground, preparing to jump, the iron fur on its withers standing up... It didn't jump, fell on its side.
The pack scrambled. Some runt, whimpering, lay down on the grass, head down, gingerly waddling his paws on the elk's carcass. The slope was steep, and the mutant twitched almost immediately, tried to crawl back, but failed and rolled down the hill. The forester loaded the double-barrel again, raised it to his shoulder. This is the last one - there will be three large beasts in the trap, not counting the youngsters, for which you can get enough to... The stalker pressed his cheek against the stock, squeezed one trigger.
And then he twisted. Pain erupted in fire, burned through his chest. He was a big man, though old, with the powerful sloping shoulders of a wrestler, a wiry neck, a broad chest - and yet he was twisted in a knot. There was a rumble, a shot went off into the air. His hand cramped, his finger on the trigger twisted by the falling gun, and he fell sideways in the moss.
The little runt fell into the hole, a resentful whimper coming from it. A succinct paw strike, a short, almost human shriek, and a rustling sound on the edge of the pit. The woodsman lifted his head with an effort, casting a hazy glance over the trap. The first attack passed, the pain eased, and the stalker felt the dewy grass tickling his neck. It was almost dark, and in the twilight he saw a black silhouette in red spots in front of him.
A big, too big even for a leader, the mutant had climbed out over the bodies of its kin and was crouched on the ground, ready to jump. The stalker squinted his eyes. The double-barrel was barely a meter away, but you'd have to move to retrieve it - and provoke a pseudo-dog. If he lay still, the beast might not attack. He was in no man's land now, after all.
The leader growled. The forester felt rather than saw its paws tense, its muscles overflowing under its spotted hide... He jumped.
The stalker rolled back, picked up his rifle and jumped to his knees, taking aim. The beast that had lost its prey skidded across the ground, leaving deep furrows. The huge head turned, its jaws open. Its fangs gleamed in the light of the rising moon. Without a sound the mutant turned and lunged at the man.
The forester fired.
With a howl, the pseudo-dog fell three paces from him and immediately rose. The forester intercepted the rifle by the butt and straightened up, swinging it like a club. Blood flowed from the pseudo-dog's neck. Teeth snapped at the man's throat, the stench of its mouth hitting his nostrils. The woodsman barely had time to retreat, and in a sweeping swing he brought his stock down on the furry head. The mutant went down, twitching its paws.
The woodsman stepped toward the spruce, leaned back against the trunk, inhaled and exhaled a few times, writhing against his chest. Quickly he loaded his gun. There were six rounds of concerted buckshot and a dozen regular cartridges left in the cartridge case on his belt.
The stalker shot at the head of the pseudo-dog trying to rise, and it fell silent. The pack on the hill, howling cowardly during the fight, howled.
- So be it," the woodlander said, turning his back on the dead leader and stalking off toward the trap. The trapped beasts, two young and a large bitch, whimpered in the pit, tearing at their sides. The spotted female would be rewarded as the dragonlord, not much smaller than him, and she must be his mate, but the undersized ones would be.
An intensified howl startled the woodsman, and he turned, listening. Damn! Too long with the pseudo-dogs in neutral territory, a pack from the neighboring area would be on the move if they heard the noise. The mutants are close, they'll be here in a few minutes.
He glanced around - moonlight was illuminating the forest, long shadows of trees stretched across the grayish grass. It was getting colder, with jets of steam escaping his nostrils. There was the smell of fallen leaves and dog hair.
The pack on the hill sprang to life, barking in several throats. How many of them were left up there? The woodsman didn't even try to make out in the darkness. He walked quickly back to the clearing where the hut and the dead leader lay. Hiding place is an unreliable shelter; angry beasts would tear it down without noticing it, and a man inside would be crushed, torn to pieces. So Lesnik did not even stop near the hut, went straight to the high upland spruce throwing his gun on his shoulder.
Branches bent and rattled, but he quickly climbed up and in a minute settled in a fork two meters above the ground. He did not climb higher, to make it easier to shoot the mutants.
Though he had been expecting them, the pseudopods, who had been overrunning the area, had appeared unexpectedly. They emerged from the bushes and onto the moonlit clearing, surrounding the corpse of the beast. The two young ones rumbled and pounced on the still warm body. The second pack, left leaderless, was circling the hill.
These beasts were common, not spotted. The gray pelts and tails cost pennies, so there was no point in fussing over them. The largest mutant took a bite out of one of the yokels, which howled, and the spotted ones on the mound responded in chorus. They made no further attempts to take the bait, but their hosts had spotted it. The leader gave the signal, the young ones dropped their dead cousin, and the mutants turned their muzzles toward the moose carcass.
- Just don't fall into the trap! - Lesnick growled, raised his rifle, and fired twice. The largest mutant fell into a puddle of moonlight.
Both packs howled. The wounded beast picked up its hind legs, trying to get up, but fell face first into the grass. The forester pressed his butt to his shoulder, aiming for the next victim. The beasts on the mound went wild, snarling, scurrying around the invisible boundary of the patch.
Then came the second attack.
The stalker pressed himself against the tar-smelling barrel, his left hand gripping the fallen rifle. His right hand went into a cramp, balled up his fingers into a fist, his nails digging into his skin. Blood ran down his wrist. He struggled to put the strap around his shoulder and wrapped his arms and legs around the barrel. He was dizzy, his chest felt as acid, the blood pulsing through his temples. His eyes darkened. The grays had smelled him, and were bouncing. Teeth snapped at his boots.
The pseudo-dogs on the mound gave way, first one, then another, then another up the hill, followed by six or seven more. No sooner had the forest ranger startled by the trap than the first animal jumped onto the moose carcass, kicked off - and in a long jump leaped over the hole. His example, one by one, was followed by the others.
Pseudopods viciously attack anyone who encroaches on their territory, but rarely stray into each other's territory, their wrath usually falling on stalkers - which is probably why the packs have been hesitant until now. Now instinct prevailed, and the beasts lunged at the strangers.
The owners, gray fur puffing and gnarling, scrambled to fight them. The forester froze in an uncomfortable stance. Beneath him, the pseudopods were at each other's throats, rolling on the ground, scattering leaves, snarling and howling. Leaning against the rough trunk, he cradled the cramped wrist of his right hand. The pain was slowly receding. The attacks seemed to become more frequent. The disease would take him to his grave before he saved up the money he needed for the operation...
As Lesnik grasped the thick branch, his palm became clammy with smelly, resin. Always weak after a second attack, he might crash before the creatures had a chance to chew on each other. He couldn't decide which was worse, sticking his neck out or getting caught in the middle of one of the fierce mutants.
The cramp had finally gone, though his trembling fingers still stiffened. Wrapping the gun strap around his right wrist, Lesnik managed to reload, lower the barrels, and fire without aiming. A blurred vision obscured his vision, but it was hard to miss the jumble of bodies below. A loud screech was his answer - the stalker was hit.
He took a breath, sat back down comfortably. Weakness set in, but the woodsman could hold on for now. With trembling hands he reloaded his gun and fired, then again. The moon was brightly illuminating the clearing, and when the veil before his eyes cleared, the stalker took aim more carefully. The coordinated buckshot, which gave the best shot, had run out, leaving only the usual rounds.
The beasts were killing each other, and he sat with his legs around the barrel, slowly loading the double barrel and firing. The wind blew, a lump flew in from above, swept by his face, scratching his cheek. The woodsman swayed on the branch, nearly letting go of the gun. Another cartridge escaped his trembling fingers and flew after the lump.
The last of the pseudo-dogs in the spotted pack dropped dead. The fight was over, and the landlords froze around the tree, muzzles raised.
The forester reached for the next round. The chances of staying alive were minimal - the beasts would tear him apart, he couldn't shoot them all. He ran his fingers through his cartridge case. Five rounds. And the beasts? One, two... eight mutants. Most of them were young, but the closest to the spruce were three tough males who could jump...
Wasting no more time in thinking, the forester raised his rifle and took careful aim. A normal buckshot wouldn't kill such a mutant. Good, if two shots would do the trick.
He pulled both triggers. The woodsman swayed, the branch beneath him cracked. The big pseudo-dog beneath the spruce jumped -
 and collapsed silently to the ground. Ready. He singled out and killed the second. There was one last round left...
The mutants jumped, howling loudly. The stalker picked up his feet, found the youngest and fired. The beast collapsed, whimpering, twitching its paws. The woodsman hoped he'd broken its spine, and the youngling wasn't dangerous, wouldn't lunge as soon as he got down to the ground.
The branch was cracking and there was no point in climbing over to another; he wouldn't be able to sit here all night, and the beasts would be out in a jiffy by morning. There were four of them left, all males. He could only hope for strength and dexterity now. Though weakness is still there...
The woodsman threw his gun violently at the nearest pseudo-dog and slumped to the ground. His eyes went black. Muttering through his teeth, he leaned against the trunk. The two jumped at him, stalker outstretched his knife hand in front of him, jamming the blade into the neck of one while dodging the teeth of the other.
The effort was too much - he fell to his side. Teeth snapped from where a man's throat had just been and the mutant snapped its muzzle into the trunk. It rolled off the trunk and whimpered, head bobbing.
And the stalker found himself face to face with the last member of the pack.
No, not the last; there was another one on the other side, snarling, blood streaming from its muzzle. The woodsman fumbled at his belt, unable to find a second knife. Where is it... nowhere to be found, but there's a shotgun lying just a step away...
The two mutants jumped simultaneously. The stalker rolled onto his side, extending his arm. The beasts collided above him and collapsed, clutching together. Paws scrambled across his body, tearing at his rough leather jacket with their claws.
Clenching his teeth, the Woodsman raised his gun and struck without looking. The butt slammed into his spine, crunching it, and the mighty, heavy buck buck buck buckled against the stalker, pinning him to the ground.
The second pseudo-dog roared, and the woodsman shoved the corpse off him and sat up with the double-barrel in his hands. Directly in front of him was an open dark maw. The enraged beast leapt...
Then the forester could not explain how or why he did it. It just happened by itself. The blued barrels of the old double-barrelled rifle went deep into his throat. Surprised eyes, a heavy wheeze... The beast tumbled to its side, the stalker pulled up, pressing down, nailing it to the ground. The male wheezed, trying to wriggle out, but the woodcutter pressed so hard that his ears buzzed and his eyes whirled. Something jangled in the mutant's throat, tearing, crunching... He scrambled - and let his breath go The ranger stood up, resting his leg on the corpse, drew his double-barreled rifle, found the knife, and went to finish off the wounded pseudo-dogs. Only when he was certain everyone was dead did he allow himself to sit down beside the spruce, leaning against the trunk - and briefly lose consciousness.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_b8_doc_9">
	<text>Between Amber and the Wilderness Territories it was not possible to pass without casualties. Thanks to secret paths and timely approaching Zharka, Mazai managed to escape quickly, but in the Wilderness he was attacked by two mercenaries. Either the lone stalker's weapons and equipment were greedy, or he got bored... In the end, both were left for good in a nettle-filled ravine, and Mazai took a bullet in his sore leg. Initially he had wanted to go further north, toward Radar and Limansk, but now he decided to turn to the deserted, quiet places northwest of Yantar, to find a cache and sit out to heal his wound.
      The bullet had entered shallowly into the fleshy part of his thigh; Mazai easily dug it out with his knife, re-tightened the wound. There wasn't much blood, but the wound affected his general well-being. Although accustomed to the stalker limp, the rate of advancement significantly reduced, the last hour he went no more than a couple of miles - and yet the area is flat and almost without anomalies.
      He passed a freight train station, overgrown with weeds, grass and bushes, bypassed on a wide arc standing on the rails of the locomotive with the only car full of sand - the machine was humming, the engine was working, why - no idea - and went deeper into the woods.
      Mazai dragged himself along the edge of the meadow, keeping in the shade of the trees, dragging his wounded leg. His thigh ached more and more, it was bleeding feebly but weakly - no wonder, he must give himself a few hours' rest. The bandage was soaking and slipping, and the painkiller that Mazai had injected himself was no longer working.
      But there was no shelter around, no uprooted tree to snuggle between its roots, no deaf ravine, no abandoned house. Quiet, peaceful, deserted. There are few anomalies with artefacts, and if so, there are hardly any stalkers. There are no military patrols at all. You can live here for a year or two without meeting anyone. Silkwood, the backwoods of the Zone - but not as sinister, gloomy backwoods as the one that stretches beyond the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and less dangerous.
      The sun touched the forest, cold pinkish rays breaking between the sparse clouds. The trees cast long shadows across the flood meadow ahead. Mazai stopped at the edge, looked over the open space from under the palm of his hand. The breeze faintly ruffled the tall, lush motley grass. Not a rut, not a black stump from the fire. Untrodden, reserved land. Tall sedge and marsh rosemary were growing nearer to trees. Perhaps the need to go deep into the woods, hide under some spreading spruce and rest, have a snack, change the bandage. Mazai felt the strength drain away with every drop of blood soaking the bandage.
      One bad thing: after the meeting with the mercenaries and other troubles such as suddenly jumped out on the trail blind dog ammunition for the machine gun was half a magazine, and in the TT - only three pieces. And the tin in his rucksack was empty.
      He had hardly entered the shade of the forest when he heard a distant splash of water, and indeed - a river. Mazai whimpered to the sound, bypassing the mounds on which grew tall bushes of blueberries. His boots sank into the moss, his soles squelched. The river banks were swampy - how would he get to the water?
      He walked along the river, hearing the gurgling and rustling of the water, but could not see it, hidden by thickets of willows. The bank gradually became higher and the ground drier. When it was no longer squelchy underfoot, Mazai was going to turn to the river - like the bushes have become rarer, and waddle with a wound on his hip is quite beyond repair - but he saw ahead a ramshackle hut, grown into the ground. Window stained with mud, dense willow-herb grows on the roof, pale pink petals fluttering in the wind.
      Mazai looks around, squinting. What a protected, ringing silence around... The hut lurks in the centre of abandoned, forgotten land. Grass, forests, fields - it seemed that the whole world consisted of them, and no people, no guns, helicopters, shooting. He had no idea there were such places left in the Zone. And this house - good stash, as if by order, as if the invisible forces that rule the Zone, had mercy on the fugitive stalker and made him a gift. Sheltered from prying eyes, beasts are not visible around, there are no anomalies - Mazai generally met them little after the Wilderness, when he turned to the northwest - but the water is available, and you can hunt. Here he bandages his wound, eats, sleeps.
      With a limp limb, the stalker hurried to the hut as best he could. The door faced the river, to the threshold led three cut in the ground steps. Already dropped his backpack, Mazai frowned, looked at them. Dumped clay lay close by, long ago hidden by grass, the steps were also overgrown, but the stalks were crumpled - people had walked here recently. Doubts buzzed in his mind: Something amiss, a free cheese in a rat-wolf trap. Why would the Zone be so generous with such a gift? Zone - cunning, crafty, bloodthirsty, it may seem helpful, may pity, but it is deceptive pity, which hides insidious, treacherous nature.
      Mazai turned, looked around the forest for a long moment. Trees, bushes on the bank, fern and moss... Nowhere, not a twig crunches, not a branch moves, the wind has settled, the serene silence all around. But a familiar feeling of threat hangs in the air, and waves of faint, tickling shivers run down my back, from my shoulders to my tailbone. And that smell...
      Bloodsucker!
      He felt as if he'd been struck in the back of the head, the word rumbling in his head. Mazai slipped his hands into the straps of his backpack and waddled away, to get as far away from the place as possible. Bloodsucker had taken a fancy to the hut - old, mature males exude a faint whiff of musty beer, you can't go wrong there. After looking around a few times, the stalker began to hastily ascend the slope. The hill is not very high, but steep, there are almost no trees here, but the top is overgrown...
      He stopped and sniffed the air.
      What a hit!
      Mazai swore in frustration. The flat, knife-like cut top of the hill was densely overgrown with blood-grass. He had dealt with it only once and hoped that he would never have to repeat that experience again.
      A very distinctive pungent scent wafted from the plant with narrow, long leaves that looked like flattened, blood-soaked fingers, covered with a dense network of fine red veins.
      You mustn't stay near a blooddrop for too long. He had once shown it to Mazai and told him all he knew: the herb is very rare, not many people have heard of it.
      The main thing - it emits poisonous gas.
      Suddenly a rusty nail poked him in the back. Startled, Mazai turned around - and glared at the bloodsucker.
      A wisp of tentacles was moving through the muddy window of the hut. The decrepit ancient bloodsucker was staring longingly hungry at the man. He was disgusted, and Mazai, raising his assault rifle, fired a short burst. He realized too late that there was not much ammunition... and now there was even less. The bloodsucker had never been shot, the bullets hitting the log above the window, the mutant vanished. Either he was invisible, or he'd retreated into the back of the house. Now comes out and chases an exhausted stalker, bleeding wound and have no ammunition left.
      Cursing, Mazai moved on. As far as he knew, the fumes of bloodsucker for a bloodsucker even more poisonous than for a man, the mutant will not go to the top of the hill.
      But how long would he himself last? How big was the thicket, would it have time to cross it before the poison reached a critical concentration in its blood?
      At the top of the hill, Mazai stopped and cursed loudly. The bloodstream stretched far away, the rising wind ruffling the narrow leaves - a whole sea of reddish green. He turned and, limping heavily, hurried along the thicket, feeling the acrid, intoxicating smell. Death, the Woodsman said, would be excruciating. Slow suffocation, when gradually, almost imperceptibly spasms of the larynx begin - the air is harder and harder to penetrate the lungs, the throat as if narrowed, after twenty or thirty minutes you begin to fight for each breath and realize that you lose in this struggle ...
      Don't think about that - think about getting away from the bloodsucker! Mazai could barely hobble anymore - fatigue was taking its toll. Does the mutant pursue him? He glanced around: the hut, the trees and bushes near it - everything was floating. He glanced around, seeing the hut, the trees and shrubs beside it, all floating. I was in my arms, and I could not tell if the mutant had followed me. Though how can there be any doubt? Such a hungry look Mazai had not seen in a long time!
      Taking a few steps down the slope to get out of the noxious fumes, he took a deep breath of clean air. His vision cleared a little, and he noticed that the grass in front of the hut was swaying - not all of it, like from the wind, but only in one place, and this swaying was moving in his direction. Mazai shook his head and limped on, deciding that he would enter the thicket only when the mutant was quite close.
      Soon he turned to see if the bloodsucker was moving quickly and almost screamed. Tentacles were floating above the matted grass. This bloodsucker is as old as a threadbare sole! He doesn't have enough strength to disappear at all...
      Mazai raised his rifle, squeezed the trigger.
      But the mutant noticed the movement of a man - and disappeared completely. Bullets whizzed over the grass, knocked the chips out of the roof of the hut. Not a sound, not a falling body - the bloodsucker, though an ancient old man, had time to recoil, Mazai missed.
      Cursing himself for wasting the last of his ammunition, the staggered onward. Now that's the end - it's a bloodsucker, not a rat! Even a wreck like that would kill a wounded, exhausted human easily.
      His leg hurt more with every step, it was swollen and hindered walking. Mazai turned into a thicket of bloodwort and crouched down, trying to breathe shallowly. Leaves with red veins swayed around them, rustling, exuding a deadly scent. From the top, the stalker got a good view of his surroundings and was finally convinced: the situation was hopeless.
      The thicket covered the entire slope and stretched further between the trees. The hill stretched forward for another twenty meters, curving to the left and meeting the river. And there, where the thicket of bloodwort came close to the water, stood a puppet tree. Mazai recognized it at once, even through the haze of poisonous fumes - and shuddered. The puppeteer had always disgusted him. The tree seemed to have even caught something, but at this distance, and with his vision blurred, he couldn't see clearly. This mutant hybrid seemed to the stalker the creation of a sick fantasy, something completely unreal. How does it catch people, how does it know when there is a victim under the crown? How the devilish way the delicate twigs fuse with nerve endings? Mazai shuddered. No, he couldn't get through there. He couldn't cross the river either - it was rather wide and the current was swift... And nowhere - not a bridge, not even a log, thrown over the dark water.
      He finally realized that he was trapped. A hungry bloodsucker in the back, a puppet tree in front, a thicket of bloodsucker on the right, a river on the left. Worst of all, he's chained to a poisonous plant - get out of it and the mutant will pounce. What's the use of sitting in the thicket? A bloodsucker wouldn't come out here, but Mazai would be dead within half an hour.
      It's a tickle in the throat, and Mazai is coughing. Now already hard to breathe - this is the beginning of the end.
      Stalker checked the ammunition - only one. Is this also a gift of the Zone? One bullet, the last one to shoot himself...
      - Suck it! - Straightening, Mazai bent his right arm and slammed his left on his bicep. - Only cowards shoot themselves. The last bullet won't go to me!
      He dropped his rucksack into the grass with a decisive movement, rummaged through his pockets, in his pouch - and found another round of ammunition. If the bloodsucker was old enough to remain invisible, he had no choice but to ambush the mutant and shoot it. Inserting the cartridge into the magazine, Mazai stepped from the tall grass onto the hillside, stood, inhaling the air less saturated with poisonous fumes, and through the haze looked over the triangular hollow between the hill, the river, and the bloodsucker hut. The hollow trembled, floated as if he were surveying it through the hot air above the fire.
      A blurred shadow flashed among the trees by the slope, tentacles floated by and disappeared. Mazai raised his rifle, waited a few seconds, carefully aiming, and then pulled the trigger.
      The bullet zigziked against the wriggling trunk of an aspen, a quiet half-stem half-sigh was heard... Got him!
      No, a bloodsucker can't be killed with a single shot, not even this wreck. A distinctive silhouette loomed up in the air, inked, darkened, then vanished again, a vague shadow darting forward and disappearing, leaving a trail of blood on the grass. Mazai stepped back, under cover of the acrid smell of blood. He hit it, but what was the use? Only pissed off, the bloodsucker might now try to grab him and drag him down to safety. He gritted his teeth helplessly, blinking his eyes repeatedly from tightness, then saw the leaves of the fern crumple down the slope in front of him. Not believing his luck, Mazai fired almost at point-blank range.
      ...And this time it didn't hit. The bullet zigzagged over the head of the mutant, climbing on all fours. The creature manifested, then slowly melted away, its image blurred in the air, trembling at the edges until it was gone.
      What bad luck! Mazai mentally told Mother Zona off, then cursed out loud. Dizzy, he could hardly stand on his feet. His throat was scratchy, hard to breathe. Mazai held back his coughing, because he knew that if he coughed it would only make things worse, the spasm would squeeze his airways faster.
      He saw no way out. He had no choice but to hole up in the thicket, or march on the bloodsucker with his automatic as a club. Either way was a hundred percent death.
      He staggered to his feet, sucking in a mouthful of deathly-scented air. As he lowered his trembling hands, the useless machine gun slipped from his grasp and fell into the tall grass.
      Immediately a bloodsucker appeared at the edge of the thicket, tentacles first, then a head, a sunken chest... Red dripped from the empty space beneath it, as if the air itself was bleeding. A dead, sullen and somehow very tired look came over his face, and a wet chill hit Mazai, as if the stalker was instantly transported to a rainy late autumn, to the piercing wind. The bloodsucker was solid and began to fade at once. The body rippled like a reflection in water, disappeared, leaving only the tentacles. They bobbed and moved away from the thicket of blood until they were no longer visible in the haze. Nothing now indicated the presence of the mutant, nor could he detect its sour odor beneath the pungent scent of the blood, but his sixth sense told him the bloodsucker was waiting.
      Mazai touched his sweaty forehead, swallowed. Blood venom saturated blood and mind, head murmurs, began strange hallucinations: he thought he heard a quiet whisper, coming from the hut - the whisper of death. And he did not want to die. Mazai had never thought about his death before, even though he was ready to meet it every day. For death threatened him swiftly - either in an anomaly, or at the fangs of a boar, in the clutches of a pseudo-giant, under the claws of pseudo-flesh... before you know it, you're gone. But never did Mazai think that he would suffer a painful, long death, and he would be so weak and helpless that he could not avoid it.
      The world shook, went in waves. Squinting, Mazai rubbed his forehead, his cheeks, scratched his palms against his stubble, touched his cheekbone. He looked around. He was standing in the thicket - ec where he had gone! Blood here is almost waist-deep, and the spirit is such that any man in a few minutes would give up.
      Shaking, he made his way back to the edge of the thicket. Thoughts fluttered sluggishly in his head, weaving like sleepy snakes, slippery and as if alien. There was one possibility. He just had to remember which one. Someone had told him, some bearded hunter... Ah yes, the forester! The forester said there's a way... But that's also almost certain death... Stop, we can't go any further! - He stopped at the very edge of the thicket. The bloodsucker was out there, though not visible. Breathing heavily, wheezing, Mazai somehow bent over, almost dropping, picked a long blade of grass, lifted it in his palm and looked closely.
      Almost certain death. The forester said...
      No, no! Better to be killed by blood fumes or bloodsucker tentacles than both at once!
      Or does it make no difference?
      There's a river, which under normal circumstances would not be an obstacle, but now it will not be crossed, he will go down, like Chapaev. Here is a puppet tree, next to it is a bloodsucker, and here is a bloodsucker. Everywhere is perdition, but...
      An agonizing cough tore at his throat and he could hardly hold it back. Mazai spat, spat at his feet, then saw the backpack lying in the grass.
      And made a decision.
      Moving like a zombie, slowly and uncertainly, he removed the small kettle from its retainer on the backpack. How much time left? No more than fifteen minutes, or rather even less, then the bleeding would bring him down.
      Mazai moved obliquely to the top of the hill, picking up dry twigs. It doesn't take much to make an infusion, just warm water to body temperature, there's no need to boil it. After tramping a small clearing a meter and a half from the edge of the thicket, he stacked the twigs in a hut and flicked the lighter on. The dried wood caught fire quickly, tongues of flame scurried along the limbs. They melted as if plastic, bent in the fire. Mazai, crouching nearby, looked up, a bloodsucker standing nearby, like a carved dark moss-covered statue, watching the man with wistful eyes.
      His eyes were blurry, the fireplace a yellow blur amidst the red-green grass. The trees on the hillside became streaks of black, the world blurred into a single grey background. The bowler suddenly turned to face Serpentine, and Mazai almost shrieked, reaching for him. The face blurred, turned into the red face of an angry Elephant. Again came the voices - a lot, on all sides, painfully droning, as from a well, the voices of all the stalkers Mazai knew in life, they vied with one another to condemn him, shouting that he was wrong for leaving the boy alone to be devoured by these beasts in human guise, all these Sharpened, Bolts, Elephants, Mar-gosh... Mazai stiffened amidst the discordant muttering, biting his lip. A drop of blood ran down his chin.
      A twig in the fire cracked loudly, and the voices faded as if a door had slammed shut.
      He sobbed, wiping the blood from his chin with his sleeve. The hardest part was to fetch water. To do that he had to go down to the river, past the bloodsucker or the puppet tree.
      Mazai took the kettle and headed down the hilltop towards the tree, shuffling like an old grandfather, hunched over and crooked. The fumes of blood curled around him in an invisible whirlwind, tilting him to the ground. He glanced sideways, a bloodsucker dragging dejectedly behind him. The mutant was no longer fleeing, he realized there was nothing left to shoot, but he leaned low to avoid the poisonous fumes.
      Three meters from the tree, the stalker froze in indecision. At what distance does the puppeteer become dangerous, how far can he stretch his branches? No one knows exactly - and those who happen to know won't tell.
      Most of all, Mazai was surprised and disgusted by the senselessness of the puppeteer's actions. Mutants attack because they are hungry and angry. Controllers take people under their mental hoods to defend themselves or use them instead for some cause. And why would a tree need human dolls? After all it is a thoughtless plant, roots and trunk with branches, what does it need except water, soil and sunlight?
      What use or what pleasure to the puppeteer to make people dance?
      One unhappy man was hanging on the branches. He resembled a mummy, his clothes hanging like on a hanger - but he was alive. Mazai turned away, looking at the bloodsucker. It was staring agonizingly hungry at the man, waiting for Mazai to leave an area too dangerous for the mutant.
      The stalker slid his hand under the wishbone of his bowler, hanging it at the bend of his elbow, threw on his hood, pulled his sleeves over his fists and squeezed the edges to conceal any area of skin. He bowed his head to his chest - and waddled under the tree with all the speed he could muster. His breathing was interrupted, an agonizing cough bursting out, his eyes blurred.
      The bloodsucker slid forward, but froze a meter from the tree and raised its tentacles in an attempt to reach its prey.
      The flexible, elastic twigs scrambled up his hood, over his shoulders, down his back, greedily searching his bare skin to suck at it, to pierce the flesh and fuse with the nerve endings. Mazai waddled, staggering. The hardest part was getting water under the tree so the bloodsucker couldn't reach him, which required exposing his hand and wrist, the most delicate spot for a puppeteer...
      ...He didn't remember how he'd reached the fire. The fire was almost out, ash covered the crumpled grass. Mazai put the kettle in the centre of the fire, threw in dried wood gathered on the way, blew up the fire. Water on the sides of the pot hissed, evaporating.
      The bloodsucker howled-a long, languid howl. He could feel its prey trying to slip away, but he couldn't see what it was up to. Mazai saw sagging skin on its face, covered with pigmented spots - a true patriarch of the bloodsucker tribe, the aksakal! He tore at the red leaves and tossed them into the cauldron. The water had warmed up a little.
      A worried bloodsucker crawled out of the bushes and crept closer, almost to the very edge of the thicket. Separated by a strip of grass, the mutant and the human looked at each other. The creature wiggled its tentacles, sniffing, took a hesitant step forward, but then backed away. Mazai couldn't stand it and coughed.
      His throat felt like sandpaper, and his lungs felt like they were filled with iron filings. Sparks exploded before his eyes, and Mazai opened his mouth and stepped to the edge of the thicket, hoping for a gulp of less poisoned air, blood dripping from his lip.
      Revived, the bloodsucker rushed forward - and Mazai staggered back toward the fire. The frustrated mutant paused, devouring its prey with its gaze, stepped back a little again.
      The stalker dipped his hand into the cauldron, to immediately feel when the broth was warm enough. He was pounding with chills, the voices of the dead and the living came again from every direction, the trees at the edge of the forest chiming, someone scary muttering in the hut, the deadly whispering of the river waves. Mazai shook his head, bent lower over the cauldron. Leaves stained the water brown. The forester said, under the influence of the broth a man loses control completely, scratching his face, convulsing, and if the broth is too strong, the spasm covers the whole body, and you die of suffocation. But if you don't brew it strong enough, the potion won't work...
      Finally Mazai decided: it's time. Grabbing the hot spout with his sleeve, he lifted the pot, tilted and began to pour the brown water into his mouth, greedily swallowing. The warm broth soothed his cough-torn throat.
      The bloodsucker hissed, crept closer, looked at the drinking man in bewilderment, could not stand it - and dived into the grass.
      Mazai threw back the empty bowler, wiped the wet leaves from his face. He struggled to straighten his legs, as if he were an athlete pushing a barbell, and staggered away from the mutant, down the hill. He had to get out of the thicket of bloodsucker, or it would be the end of him.
      The bloodsucker dragged behind him, whispering and groaning. He moved with difficulty, but he caught up, for Mazai could barely stagger out of his way. When the stalker realized that the mutant was very close, he fell on his side and rolled down the slope. The creature, tentacles outstretched and wailing maternally, hurried after him.
      Stalker froze, lying on his back, as he rolled toward the valley. His eyes went black and the last thing Mazai saw was the inhuman face above him, and the last thing he remembered was the cold tentacles that clung to his neck.</text>

	<text>As the damp, sticky sponges engulfed his body, the Chemist clenched his eyes and clenched his teeth without removing his hands from his knife. He really didn't like the way this was going, he hated this kind of position - if he wasn't in control of the situation, he was uncomfortable. Right now, though, the Chemist wasn't sure he could cut through the flexible limbs. Though the surface was soft and pliable, the tentacles had a lot of strength. It was a little reassuring to know that Limp had made it safely past the entrance - the companion loomed in semi-darkness, three meters from the border of light and shadow.
     Limp looked at Chemist, ready to come to the rescue. Tentacles cupped his stalker, rubbed his clothes, smeared with yellowish secret, and then ducked. Chemist stepped into the dark womb of the hill. He stood beside Limp. - Do you think it would be possible to turn on a lantern here?
     - We'll find out now.
     With a click the torch on the frame of the hood flashed, a white beam of light slid down the cave. Dozens of furry beasts swarmed beneath their feet. When light fell on them, they squeaked, squinted, strayed into the shadows, or froze in a torpor. It was difficult to estimate the size of the vault, tentacles dangling from the ceiling and wriggling gently. Unlike those lurking near the entrance, the stalactite tentacles behaved passively, only occasionally coming into motion - turning around, dropping to the ground floor, touching mutants' backs. They squirted out their secret, and the tentacles rose again. But the massive tentacles, coiled in thick loops, hung at the entrance, awaiting their new guests and not trying to slip into the depths of the dungeon.
     Scatterings of tiny crystals glittered on the floor between the tentacled gatekeepers. - Looks like roots," the Chemist remarked. - I'll go up the hill later to see what's up there.
     The shaggy creature slid between the stalkers' legs, landed on the curled tentacles, pinched a crystal with its forelegs, and emerged into the light.
     - It doesn't touch anything that comes out," the Smith remarked. - Well, we've got to find my goofball.
     The stalkers moved between the scales, dangling from the cave vaults. Limp walked cautiously over the mutants, still dazed by the light, while Chemist hurled the beasts out of the way a couple of times. He'd already made sure they were harmless, so he didn't bother. The furry creatures shrieked when their boots touched and rolled away.
     Limp looked around curiously, interested in the life of the underground colony: the scurrying critters often bumped into each other, sniffed at each other and scattered away. There was a sense of order to the mutants' movements, like ants swarming in an anthill. He turned on the lantern, too, and looked up, where the pale sprouts that covered the vault hung languidly in their sway. The floor was a dark, sticky mass, apparently composed of the colony's waste and refuse, treaded by the mutants' clawed feet. Pieces of skeleton belonged to both humans and mutants.
     Wandering between the tentacled stalactites, the two stalkers remained silent. It was stuffy and damp under the moving canopy, the cave filled with the specific smell of secretion secreted by the mutants. Outside in the wind the fragrance was pleasant, but in the cave it was tangy, bitter, and it made my nose twitch and my eyes water.
     The cave was not too large, about thirty paces long. Then the lanterns illuminated the far wall of tentacles. Here they were particularly dense, with no ceiling between them, and the floor concealed under a carpet of scattered skeletal fragments. The stalkers saw a blind dog, apparently the same one they had caught recently. The mutant was lying on its back under the wall, barely visible beneath the heap of swarming cave dwellers.
     - What are they doing to the dog? Ah? Is that... intercourse? - There was a look of surprise in Limp's voice.
     The dog was showing no activity, and the little mutants were fidgeting very vigorously on him. Looking closely, Limp noticed that several tentacles were escaping under the pile of furry critters - they seemed to be holding the dog down or perhaps paralyzing him in some way. The chemist bent down, clawed a furry one that ran underfoot, flipped it over... then flung it away, grabbed another, a third...
     - I wish I were dead," he muttered. - It's the females.
     - So where's Thumb? -- responded Limp. - Oh!
     - What?
     - The PDA is vibrating... I'd forgotten it was muted. There's an anomaly somewhere nearby.
     The beams of the lanterns flickered over the languidly moving tentacles, revealing the still body of Thumb. Farther away, tiny bolts of lightning flashed ghostly, flickered, spiraled, and extinguished in the darkness of the cave. Crystals glittered near the anomaly, the same ones the furry creatures had carried with them when they ventured out. The unknown anomaly did not interest the stalkers now, they rushed to Nikita.
     He was lying with his arms outstretched, animals crawled over him, fiddling with his soft paws, twitching his belt, overalls, pulling boots laces ... Above the stalker moved soft rounded mass, like a bloated bubble. On top of the bubble was a swollen shapeless head, lean limbs sticking out to the sides. The bloated man-like creature hung from its abdomen, held down by sprouting tentacle roots; its mouth hung in folds of pale, glossy skin; its wide-set eyes had no pupils, only round whites; a yellow substance, secreted by small hairy mutants, coagulated thickly around its walls and tentacles. Beneath the fresh, damp streaks were brown, dried from time.
     - What is it? - Limp half whispered in surprise.
     - I'll explain later! - The chemist shouted, "Get the fool, and take him out! Come on, Limp, hurry up, damn you!
     When stalkers kicked an indignant shrieking mutants, it became clear that Prihorshnya lying on top of a pile of tattered overalls, shirts and jackets - before him on this bed has visited a considerable number of poor. Nikita's arms and legs were entangled in serpentine spurs. Limp cut the tentacles with a knife, threw off the loops. The creature with the bloated belly shuddered, limbs trembled, eyeballs slowly twisted in swollen folds, cloudy, blurry pupils appeared, fat chunks of flesh moved in place of the mouth ...
     Pale tentacles swung about, weaving and unweaving rings, scrambling blindly beneath them. Limp kicked them away with his legs and pulled Fist towards the exit.
     The chemist, drawing his rifle, put several bullets into the monster's head. The head exploded, the swollen belly convulsed, and immediately the forest of tentacles was on the move - the cave was filled with rustling and squelching sighs, the little mutants screeching among the agitating spurs. They sputtered a yellow substance, the tentacles agitating even more because of it. Dark branched veins appeared on the greasy bubble. The bubble began to shrink and quiver, splashing out a stream of clear oily liquid... and a wet purple lump spilled out. It unfolded, twitching its tiny limbs, shrieking. The mutant had been born prematurely-the fur was sticking together in shreds, its thin skin pulsing with ulcerations. The hide was cracking, fluid oozing from beneath it.
     Limp gave a long burst, the bullets hitting the tentacles, ripping open the elastic serpentine bodies, wet wisps flying. But the firing had no significant effect. While Limp fired, the Chemist reloaded his rifle. Khromoy threw the assault rifle behind his back, picked Nikita up under his arms, and dragged him towards the exit. Khimik ran beside him, chopping with his knife, shoving the tentacles off with his barrel as they tried to block Khromoy's path with his burden. The stalactite tentacles were not a serious obstacle, but the ones guarding the entrance were dangerous. The stalkers, halted, raised their weapons and fired whatever was left in the magazines, crushing the forest of blistering harnesses. The chemist rushed forward first. Some of the guards remained motionless - their program of not touching those coming out was still in effect - but a pair of serpentine spurs rushed towards the stalker. Wielding his knife, the Chemist shouted: - Limp, quick!
     Limp grabbed the senseless body again, dragged it outside, stepping on the blue crystals, staggering and dragging it along the path away. The rain poured with all its might outside, torrents of rain pounding the ground; hissing and gurgling water trickled down the clay slope. Limpy slid down, taking Fistfull with him, glancing up as he went, Chemist reaching into the darkened opening of the cave and drawing something from the container with his free hand.
     The bushes obscured his view, and then an explosion rumbled behind him. Limp stopped, unclenched his numb fingers. Streams of water dripped down his face and over his suit, washing away the layer of yellow secretion, which had already begun to dry, shrink with a sticky crust. Leaving Fist lying face up, Limp took a few steps up the slope and saw smoke billowing from the cave, and the Chemist was almost free of his tentacles. The pale spurs, stripped of their control, became sluggish and attacked tentatively. The Chemist bent down, grabbed a handful of crystals and tugged away.
     - Anomaly? - Limp shouted. - Look out! He spotted the acid widow, too. He darted sideways, several artifacts tumbled between his clenched fingers, down the slope, down the path, one plunging into the anomaly. It boiled over, splashes of fire flew, raindrops hissed as they met lightning... The chemist collapsed in the bushes, rolled away, and where he had just been, the lightning-beaten bushes turned black, disintegrating into chaff. The rain quickly washed away what was left of them, forming a dark gaps around the anomaly.
     - Chemist! - Limp called out.
     Thunder rang out, the rain poured down with renewed vigour.
     - Chemist!
     - Don't shout... I'm here..." Stalker stood heavily out of the thicket, gripping his rifle and trampling through the bushes, walking towards the pacified anomaly. - Dropped it somewhere... Yeah.
     In the grass among the bubbles, boiling under the blows of large drops, shone a crystal. The chemist peered at it, then swore in surprise. The acid-widow artefact had changed, turned green, and changed shape. It was larger, smoother and harder than the crystal he had dropped in the grass.
     - Interesting," the stalker muttered. - This thing was made by an anomaly in the cave, but if you bathe it in an acid widow, it turns green ... You hear, Limp? It's green and completely different! Have you ever seen that before?
     - Chemist! Get out of here!
     Lump still wasn't conscious, but at least he was breathing, his arms and legs shook occasionally, his muscles contracted. The chemist joined Limp, the two of them dragged Nikita away from the cave.
     Once they reached the oak tree, under which Khromoy had buried the loot, the exhausted stalkers sank into the grass beside the outspread body. Thunderstorm went somewhere to the south, it got lighter, rain became weaker, but it is not over yet. Drops drummed on the leaves, soaking the moisture-soaked ground.
     - Uh..." he wheezed, wiping his forehead with his sleeve. - Heavy partner you have, bogatyr...
     Handful called:
     - Katya, what are you...? Hear, Katya ... - Then opened his eyes, looked around heavily breathing stalkers and asked surprised: - And where Katya? Where have they taken Katya? Hey, I'm talking to you! Are you deaf?
     The chemist grimaced, and whispered something.
     - What?" Prigorodny tried to rise, clutching his temples with his groaning hands. - I've got a headache... Why don't you say something?
     - All right. - The chemist got up. - Wait here, I'll get the Kid.
     Angrily looking at Nikita, he left. He followed his partner with a puzzled look, and when a silhouette disappeared in a pall of rain, he asked Limp:
     - What's he up to? Jumped out of nowhere, then left again, didn't he?
     - Don't you remember anything? Nikita rubbed his temples.
     - Actually, I feel like I've missed something interesting, like where's our loot? I don't remember where we put it... But it was Katya! If she hadn't called me, I wouldn't have gone. Limp, you're looking at me weird, too. What's the matter? It's not my fault that I get hit on by women!</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_b9_doc_8">
	<text>I tell you guys honestly: when your closest friend, to whom you have more than once saved your life in the Zone, with whom you have side by side with many times fought off military stalkers and marauders, with whom you have always shared your last can of canned meat, and with whom you have drunk more than one tank of fuel and lubricants in the bar "Shti", aims a pistol at you from forty paces - then the pleasure is far below average.
It's utterly disgusting, in case anyone hasn't realised it yet.
As an ostrich from a cartoon said in a similar situation, I've never been in such a stupid position even in Canada.
- Hold still, Hemul," said Patogenic, as he clutched the grip of his pistol with both hands. His voice trembled a little from the exertion, and I did not like it at all. - Stay still. Don't you move at all, you dog, or I'll put a hole in your forehead like that. You'll walk around with a hole in your forehead like a jerk.
I licked my lips frantically. I glanced again and again at the distance between us. Fuck. Shit.
- Okay, brother," I said, trying to keep my voice dry and independent. I'm not sure I got it right, but at least I tried. - If you decide to shoot, then shoot, there's nothing to talk about. Not in the Verkhovna Rada.
- Chemil, don't tell me how to make kids," said Patogenych grimly.
The black muzzle of the pistol muzzle hypnotized me, preventing me from looking away. I must have been staring at it like a rabbit at a boa constrictor. Catching myself in the moment, I forced my eyes down, glancing past Patogenic, frozen in the gate of the dilapidated farmhouse. Out of the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of the forest in the distance, a dilapidated iron barrier, the rusted-out remains of an ancient ZIL car that had been parked on the farmyard and remained there forever, and whimsical clouds in the piercing blue sky, swirling in a huge foamy spiral. Subconsciously expecting a gunshot every second, he took a meticulous look around the grey walls of the room. Everything inside was either grey, black or cobwebby. General ruin, an abomination of desolation. As I entered the bloody barn I noticed an invisible carnivorous mushroom on the wall, swollen with an ugly growth in the middle of the untidy damp stains on the old black plaster, but then I was distracted by the steep troubles, and now I could not remember exactly where it sat: the foul predatory plant blended perfectly with the greyness, blackness and cobwebs around it. But why should I care about it now, when the stopwatch of my life seemed to be counting down the last sweet moments? What, after all, what trifles always occupy my head in moments of mortal danger...
Do not believe those romantics in books, who say that a person's whole life passes before his/her eyes in a moment before death. Nonsense, I assert authoritatively as an expert in the matter. At this moment in absolutely empty head only a pair of lonely thoughts about the hidden invisible mushroom and the burnt shoulder with burning feather, and also silly fleeting regret that a lot of money for a precious artifact, for which you now almost certainly will remain lying here with a shot in the head, will safely march past you. Yes, and a hysterically flickering at the edge of your consciousness like a green man at a traffic light: "Unfair! Not fair!" All clever newbies naively think that a real tough stalker must think only in manly swear words, especially in critical situations, and the word "unfair" is suitable only for kindergarten or teenage novels; go to hell, clever people. Somehow the surrounding countryside is strewn with your bones and not mine.
What difference does it make, though, if there's only one end anyway. I have trampled the Zone many times longer than you, smart guys, and what's the use?
I closed my eyes tiredly, unable to see the years of dust and cobwebs around me anymore. There was still no shot. It's not right that the last thing you see before you die is dust and cobwebs. There's some kind of supreme meanness about it.
As soon as my eyesight stopped transmitting its eighty percent of information to my brain, all my other senses became acute. Sometimes I used this trick when I could not understand what was bothering me on the trail, why I could not take the next step on the trail, although my eyes did not distinguish even the slightest danger. Often this worked, and I quickly discovered the source of the alarm.
The distant rumble of propellers immediately became audible - a peacekeeper patrol helicopter was barreling over the Junkyard. As soon as it was heading in our direction, the analysis centre in my head clicked automatically: it was circling over the Dogs' Village towards the Perimeter. There was a piercing smell of burning and sourness from a corpse of pseudo-flesh lying in a nearby stall. The ribbed surface of the bolt head in my fingers. What do I need a bolt for now? All right, let it be. To die with a bolt in hand is every stalker's dream! A beautifully heroic phrase, at a level of idiocy well worthy of being inserted into an ostrich cartoon. The heavy, intermittent breathing of the Pathogenic, audible even from this distance. He'd better quit smoking, or lung cancer would drive him to his grave in a few years. And it's not so easy to shoot his old comrade in arms. Breaks it, doesn't it, brother? Still no shot. I wonder if I'll have time to hear the shot or die before its rumble catches up with the bullet that ran ahead...?
And then there was a subtle sickening sound in the impenetrable gloom that surrounded me - right in front of me. It is barely perceptible, almost inaudible, masked even by the whisper of the grass in the lazy wind, but it is no less sinister and unpleasant - as if someone is striking again and again the back side of a two-handed saw, and its bent blade vibrates and sings in an unnatural voice, choking and sobbing, like an unearthly creature with four bullet wounds in its chest.
Deciding, though, that waiting for the shot to go off with my eyes closed was not constructive, I stared straight into the muzzle of the Beretta again. Hello, darling.
And this shitty day was off to a pretty good start. After spending the night in "Stalker" bar, early in the morning two of us set out to Militar. The sun was burning like mad, I couldn't even believe that it was already deep autumn. However, it is always deep autumn in the Zone, even in late spring. The last blowout was long ago, so our clan already had more or less established trail to Militari-not that completely safe, but at least minimally marked on the ground. Another thing is that further north, in the level where we were now headed, the anomalies were always a wall, and even the most seasoned veterans preferred not to climb here alone or in pairs. Good artefacts are often born on the Militaria, but such a risk is still not justified. A sortie requires five six minimally trained lock picks, just in case. For your own peace of mind. And an experienced assistant mastermind. Again, and from looters and boars to be able to fend off, if anything, without too much difficulty.
However, when you are carrying a terribly expensive artifact in a container, and there are five or six unpredictable guns around, the situation comes out rather ambiguous. And then you have to divide the loot amongst everyone if you're carrying half a dozen lock picks. Not that I and Patogenych life were pathologically greedy, but when he plumped next to me on a high stool bar, "Sti" and laid out on the counter printout file with PDA one dead tramp whose body was found near the abandoned military base, I immediately realized that we do not need picklocks in this case.
Apparently, the stalker from the "Clear Sky" clan went to the Militaria alone. Otherwise, it would be incomprehensible why his partners left his body in the Zone chained to the concrete slab, with all the weapons and equipment, as well as so valuable information. By the way, he had received some money for his portable computer from the system genius Che; he had probably gained twice as much by selling it to the Clear Sky, but that was not our business. Except that beforehand my colleague had rummaged through the dead man's PDA and downloaded all the curious information he could find in the electronic memory. And he erased one file from the trash just in case.
Carefully studying the printout of that very file, I looked up at Patogenic:
- Is that exactly what I think it is?
- Who knows what you're thinking," said Patogenic reasonably, lifting a shot of clear with three fingers. He grunted thoughtfully, put it down on the counter, and tapped a piece of paper in front of me: "But it must be very interesting, brother.
I figured it out myself. Just asking, just in case of fire. On the printout were pictures of sections of terrain and anomaly detector readings. Very blurry images and very approximate anomaly detector readings. However, it was already enough to take a chance. Boil your milk...! The Clear Skies lad was quite experienced enough to work out exactly what this arrangement of anomalous fields might mean, but not experienced enough not to make any notes about it on the PDA. Or maybe he didn't understand it himself and wrote it down on purpose so that he could show it to some veteran and find out more exactly what such an amazing picture meant. And it meant one simple but important thing: wealth. Or instant death-well, that depends.
- Egg," I said, shoving the clear one toward me.
- "I've got a good idea," said Patogenic, taking the printout from me and shoving it carefully into the inside pocket of my jean jacket. - Shout louder, dog, or maybe the whole bar won't hear you.
- Dangerous business," I said, politely lowering my voice even though I was already speaking in an almost whisper. - A powder keg.
- A heap of money," said Patogenitsch immediately. - Two piles of money. The last egg was discovered three years ago. That makes three piles of money.
- For two," I said, just in case, so that there would be no tragic misunderstanding between the companions.
- Of course. Four piles of money for two. And if they won't go in, what good would it do to take them with us anyway? No money to spend? An extra veteran won't make a difference, it'll just get in the way.
- He may not have it on him," I said anxiously. - He may not have so much money on him when we bring him this thing. He should prepare the right amount of money in advance.
- And we must calculate and agree how we leave the bar with so much money, - Patogenic added. - All kinds of surprises are possible. And how to dispose of this sum afterwards. Because it has to be very quickly, rumours would spread very quickly...
That was the end of the preliminary talks, because Faza landed on a nearby stool behind the bar. Good man - Faza, but why does he know about the deviled egg? That's what I'm saying: absolutely no reason for a good man Phaza to know about the deviled egg.
Pathogenic and I went through the Perimeter like a knife through butter. It's beautiful. After the memorable grandiose breakthrough, the military has not yet been able to fully restore the integrity of the first line of defense, so we had no particular problems. We carefully cut open a barbed-wire fence, carefully patched up a hole, shockingly overcame mine and managed to disappear into the woods, before the chirping of patrolling helicopters, either flying over our souls, or making a routine overflight of the territory, could be heard from Chernobyl 4.
Backing each other up, we crossed a short diagonal of the Junkyard, successfully passed Agroprom, without too many adventures bypassed Amber Lake and made it to the bar "Stalker". We spent the night here, because we entered the Zone in the evening, hastily gathered immediately after the military council in the "Stacks. Climbing through the maze of anomalous fields at night, in total darkness - no thanks, I know more elegant ways of suicide. Beasts along the route we met sparsely: The big breakthrough took too much biomass, which burned on the outskirts of Kiev military, and now the creatures are increasingly bred and multiply somewhere in the depths of the Zone, the fourth power unit, trying to restore its former numbers. During the entire raid, we have shot only pseudo-flesh, a wild boar, three blind dogs near the Dog Village, and three looters. All in all, we didn't use up a horn of ammunition all the way to the Militia. It was a laughing matter.
Marauders attacked us on the outskirts of the Dump, although it was obvious that we were going to the Zone empty-handed, and not returning with loot. However, even without that we had something to take off: at a glance it was clear that the men who came were experienced, thorough, and equipped according to all the rules. A couple of our PDAs would already be enough to sit modestly in a Sty bar. Plus anomaly detectors, plus weapons, plus sturdy boots in which to trample the Zone comfortably. However, it should have been obvious at a glance that messing with such serious people was costly. I honestly wouldn't have been surprised to find that we'd spotted the marauders a few moments before they spotted us. After all, Pathogenic and I know all the places in the Dump where you can set up a proper ambush. In short, as soon as the exchange of fire began, we immediately pinned two of them with short bursts to the trees behind which they were hiding. The third tried to get away, but my hopfool's aiming device did not fail this time either. It was not for nothing that I had taken this toy from Hye Hye before he left the Zone for good. The machine gobbled up a standard forty-five round from an M 16, so I had no problem with ammunition.
On the corpses of marauders we found almost nothing interesting and requisitioned only cartridges, half a bottle of vodka and an empty packet of cigarettes. The penny artifacts we shook out of their containers wouldn't even pay for the effort to bend over for them, especially on a day like this, when we were on our way to get a bloody egg. A mouldy half a loaf of smoked sausage, a half-empty first aid kit and a soggy, crumbling loaf of bread we naturally shrugged off too.
The Militia level, as if by order, was not fully covered. Over the past three days, part of the almost continuous anomalous front that had been cutting its territory almost in half for the past week had shifted to the north-east. Half of the contact pairs had been completely discharged. All this was to our advantage, but there was a risk that in such circumstances the rare intersection of heterogeneous anomalous fields at the point of interest had also disintegrated. As we were walking at random, not even fifty percent sure that a lucky coincidence had produced a precious artefact at all, such news did not make us optimistic.
Ahead of us stretched the long-abandoned cattle complex of a large farm. At the time of the first bombing they were called something ridiculous, either kibbutzim or klohozim. In short, it was a Hebrew word. The three animal quarters were arranged in a huge U-shape. On the small concrete fence in the yard there were piles of abandoned trucks, sagging and rusted out, and a Belarus tractor, lolling over sideways in the corner. Nearby was a new Niva, shiny in the sun, as if it had come off the assembly line yesterday. But they haven't made such a model since the last century.
We crouched behind the hill and scrutinized the cowsheds through the army binoculars of Patogenitch. This is it, this place. Everything fits. It was this concrete letter P that the late stalker had captured, and almost from this very spot. Fact. Here's the power substation, here's the lodge with the former office space, here's the creek, here's the huge ugly tree, as if twisted by giant hands. And here's an anomalous field. The sensor seemed to go berserk: according to its readings, there were meat grinders on top of bird carousels, springboards colliding with gravity shoulders, and fryers hovering above all this outrageousness. Of course, it doesn't work like that, heterogeneous anomalies never touch each other, there is always a passage between them. Only single-type traps merge into solid impenetrable swaths, and not always. Now it remained to be seen how wide these very passages between the anomalies were - say, whether a slightly larger than average-sized stalker could squeeze through them.
As we made our way to the site, I mostly walked ahead. It's stalker law: if you've been taken on an outing for rich loot, you're welcome to work it off. No questions asked. But when we had reached our goal, the workout was over. Now the most difficult part of the mission lay ahead, so Patogenic and I were on an equal footing for the moment. Otherwise it would have turned out that he had taken me on as a locksmith to rake in the heat with other people's hands; but I know how to make money in less risky ways, too. I mean, I'm willing to take some pretty serious risks, but when I'm working for myself, not for an outsider. Even if that uncle is Pathogenic.
- Well, what? - asked the colleague in a low voice, not taking his eyes off the dilapidated barn. - On a "stone - scissors"?
- It`s all right.
A game known to everyone since childhood: opponents throw their right arms forward simultaneously. The hand is either clenched in a fist - "stone", or open - "paper", or two outstretched fingers - "scissors". Scissors cut paper, paper wraps stone, stone blunts scissors. It's all very simple.
The fool in the first round is likely to throw away the "stone". He naively believes that the "stone" is something solid and firm, the strongest position in the game, which is unambiguously superior to the fragile "scissors" and the thin and weak "paper". However, this is an illusion, all signs in this game are equal: each beats one sign and beats the other. None of them has absolutely any advantage - but even if a fool is able to comprehend this with his mind, on a subconscious level he will still seek the "stone" as a symbol of power and steadfastness. Therefore, an intelligent but inexperienced person will certainly throw away the "paper" first. This is the simplest, most intuitive logical task - mate in one move.
With this in mind, a smart and experienced person in a game with a fool or a child will throw out "paper", and in a game with a smart but inexperienced one, "scissors". Mate in two moves.
A master of the game, calculating the combination a few moves ahead, must very subtly and unmistakably determine the opponent's degree of intelligence, ability to analyze, and experience. When playing with an intelligent and experienced opponent, he is bound to roll a stone first, but only if he is convinced by circumstantial indications that his opponent is capable of calculating the game move by no more than two moves. For most people, this is the limit for calculating a multi-move game in everyday conditions - further they start to get confused, so the master does not take a great risk. At least, his chances of winning are much higher than those of his opponent.
In the game of master against master there are no rules for the first move. Blind chance decides everything on the first move. However, one should still keep in mind that the probability of "stone" falling out in such a situation is a bit lower than that of the other two signs, due to the same reason that a fool or a child is more likely to immediately throw out the "stone": subconsciously the master tries to avoid repeating this primitive mistake. However, this is also a mistake, because this behaviour from the opposite direction can be deduced by the other master and taken advantage of. The main challenge in playing with a master is not to let him catch himself in any behavioural pattern, which he manages to turn to his advantage.
Masters of the game are delicate psychologists and can sometimes predict up to ninety percent of the characters that an inexperienced opponent would use. Scientific studies would probably recognise such a result as experimentally proven clairvoyance.
In short, on the first move Pathogenic and I threw out two "scissors".
OK; now that's a different matter. The first move is like "e2 - e4" in chess: before it no strategy can be developed, but after it there is the widest field of combinations. However, in contrast to chess, long openings, draws and defences are not applicable here: every subsequent move can turn out to be the last. This is a superblitz, the winner is not the one who can painstakingly build complex and cunning traps, but the one who is more accurate and faster able to calculate the opponent's train of thought. And the one who is clever enough to risk according to his calculations.
In the next round, I once again take out the "scissors", and Patogenych the "stone".
One - zero.
Right. For the third time in a row the "scissors" are unlikely to fall out, it would already be a clear pattern; however, there is a slight possibility that Patogenych, wishing to confuse me with his unpredictability, would decide to blowout just them. I looked carefully at my opponent. No, unlikely; he clearly understands that I am now alert. The possibility of "scissors" is negligible, so I do not take it into account. So it's rock or paper. "Rock" or "paper"? If I, in his opinion, expect a third "scissors", there will be "paper" to wrap my "rock". If not, and I, the cunning beast, am about to blow out the "scissors" myself in order to confuse my opponent, then the "stone" will fall out.
Looking straight into the impenetrable face of my opponent I throw the "paper". Patogenic has the "stone". Well, you bet, old fox. Who did you want to cheat.
The game continues until three wins. We rack our brains, trying to calculate our options, trying to act as unpredictably as possible, but catching the opponent in his own blunders and not falling for the enemy's tricks. Delightful work for analytical centres of brain, as if you sparring simultaneously with two swinging makiwara - you should hit one and dodge the second at the same time. It's great for abstract thinking.
Two scissors fall out again, then Pathogenic returns the spit to me, wrapping up my 'rock'. Two - one not in my favour. Two "stones" fall out next. Two "papers". Two "stones". I then match the score by blunting Pathogenic's "scissors". You should also keep in mind all the moves, all the sequence of symbols rolled before - from this, too, patterns in the opponent's behaviour necessary to win can be extracted.
Tension builds, the spectators in the stands stand stand in awe.
Two "scissors".
Two "stones".
Two "scissors".
Two "papers".
- A smoke break? - I suggest. Pathogenic shakes his beard, looks at me sideways. He calculates the combinations in his mind.
My retort does not simply disrupt the rhythm of the game and distract him from analysis. There are many secondary associations associated with a cigarette break. A cigarette paper, a cardboard cigarette pack, paper advertising posters, a piece of newspaper for smoking. I wipe my sweaty forehead, stall, and stare at Patogenic. In a few seconds the association should be firmly embedded in my opponent's subconscious. You know, like when you accidentally hear the name of a popular song or band, and after a few minutes you suddenly catch yourself humming a familiar tune. You start to untwist the associative line and you realize where it came from. But this happens later, at the level of consciousness. At first, subconsciousness obediently extracts that same motif from its dusty archives and hands it to you - here, master! Isn't that what you said?
If everything goes right, Pathogenic will not even realize at first why he suddenly threw away the "paper". He'll think it was the result of his own clever analysis.
I confidently throw away the "scissors" and receive the same in return. No, it's no good catching an old, experienced pike on a bare hook. A pathogenic pike is not a raccoon that can be manipulated at will. If, of course, you know its weaknesses well.
Still, we must try again. Two "scissors" for the third time in one-round increments is already a stable logical sequence, and the first task of the master in this game - to destroy any external logic of his actions, so that the opponent is not able to calculate them. And now Pathogenic will probably try to do just that. Most likely, the association he was looking for has already been firmly lodged in my colleague's subconsciousness, secured by the latest "scissors" - an object which in real life is closely linked with the paper.
Again, without thinking twice, I threw the "scissors" away - and got onto the "stone" of Patogenic.
Oh, boy. Well, I guess I outsmarted myself.
- You are too small against Batya, dog," commented the colleague phlegmatically, shoving his hands into pockets.
- Don't be too shabby in your self-importance, - I muttered.
We walked leisurely down the hill to the barn, like the three bulls in the joke; there were only two of us, but we were definitely worth three of us. We stopped half a hundred yards from the nearest building, eyeing the rough, weather-beaten walls, covered in a bizarre lilac lichen. Never so much lichen outside the Perimeter-perfectly round, with a spongy surface and a halo of sharp serrations along the edges. It looks as if it's about to bite you in the arm.
- Well? - Patrogenitch inquired. - Will you go by the devices?
- Do you have another suggestion? - I snapped back weakly.
There was no other suggestions.
I took the "hopfool", thrown over my shoulder, and carefully put it on the grass. I slipped the straps of the backpack off my shoulders and set it next to me: the smaller my size, the better. No telling how narrow the gaps between the anomalies I would have to crawl through. I gave the Pathogenic all the sensors and my PDA, not to have them draw a stray charge when I squeezed myself up against the meat grinders. Of the weapons I kept only a bayonet knife in a dielectric scabbard.
- Good work, vagabond, - Patrogenic admonished me, taking up such a position, that it was more convenient to fix on the sensors the anomalous fields, surrounding the barn. This is called "following the gauges": a slave moves very carefully in a particularly dangerous place, relying only on his senses, trying to see, hear and sense the lurking danger in the surrounding space. Because it's not a good idea to move while looking at the sensors and the surroundings at the same time, you are bound to miss something, be it here or there. To avoid such misfortune, the master attentively observes the light marker of the friend moving on the screen of anomaly sensor and gives voice commands to the slave - where to shift, where to slow down, where to turn. The slave, on the other hand, opens himself fully towards the Zone and corrects the data transmitted by the leader according to his own sensations. Naturally, such a trick will not work with an ordinary beginner: he has too much experience, so he cannot rely on his gut feeling and has to strictly follow all the master's commands. In order to be able to walk by the gauges safely and confidently, the flout must trample the Zone for at least two years. I'm not even talking about the leader anymore.
I moved slowly towards the half-destroyed structure, taking short, barely noticeable steps. Step. Step. Step. A streak of burned, yellowed grass to the right, standing out clearly against the brown-green, rain-soaked turf. A trifle far away; and Pathogenic is silent. At ten o'clock a small meat-grinder crackles, nibbling with tiny purple lightning bolts on a blade of grass swaying in the wind, covered with dewdrops. Meatgrinder is an odd name for an electrical anomaly; in fact, it was once the name of a now entirely defunct trap that slowly and expertly ground humans into minced meat and broken bones. Why their name was passed on to these lightning bolts, which appeared a little later, is anyone's guess. The Clear Skies hobos call them 'electrics', the 'debtors' call them 'sockets', the 'free ones' call them 'batteries'. Not a godsend either.
Step. Step. In the wide doorway wiggling in the draught long tangled icicles of rusty hair, like a bloodsucker beard: then, when entering will have to bow to the masters of the Zone, so as not to burn his head, and you must carefully watch under the feet so as not to come off and fell down on the pieces of red icicles. Your shoes are brand new, it would be a shame. They will eat through till the evening. Step. Step. Step. To my left there is an impressive circle of grass, dented and flattened, and nearby, to reach with my hand, a generous scattering of "wolf's tears". Of course, I do not bend down for them. One of the main stalker laws: when you go on a big deal, do not be distracted by trifles, do not be squandered on small things, do not be greedy - you'll be safer. Black Stalker does not like greedy.
Step. Step. According to my estimation, I was already moving through invisible anomalous fields, but Patogenitch was still silent. I was even going to call him if he fell asleep, when he finally spoke:
- Left three. Carousel.
I obediently took a right, though I couldn't make out any sign of a bird carousel to the left. But it was unlikely that Patogenic was simply testing my compliant nature.
- Two-twelve," Patogenic's voice reached me. - Circles. Three nine. Wait.
Obeying the commands of my leader, I turned away from the entrance of the barn, though it was only three meters away from the barn, a seemingly perfectly clear space.
- Turn over," Patogenic continued to command, using the terminology adopted by our clan to denote the slightest turns and movements on rough ground. - Eleven. Standing by. Right five. Springboard. Right two. Stop! Where are you going, dog! Eight, right two...!
So I took small steps and made a wide arc in front of the door, passing a meat grinder crackling with morning dampness and something else invisible, probably another bird carousel, because on the free space by the wall some untidy lumps were lying like a torn to shreds carcass of a crow. Then I turned again towards the barn gate. From the outside my crazy route must have looked like a slalom course. But there was nothing I could do about it. Good, if the solid anomalous field has a passageway inside at all, otherwise we would have to come back with nothing.
Pathogenic continued to lead me down an invisible corridor between deadly traps. I squeezed close to the dormant bird carousel, feeling its caressing breath on my face. An icy needle pulsed in the back of my neck, the tips of my fingers tingled, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end, and my eyes felt as if dry sand had been poured into them-an organism that reacted sensitively to the close proximity of heterogeneous anomalies. I could hardly walk through here alone. Any step aside now, any wrong move could be my last. I was focused, collected, and attentive. I listened carefully to my own senses, trying not to miss the slightest rustle, the slightest change in my surroundings.
- Right seven. Stand by," Patogenic commanded me in a businesslike manner. - Stand by. Tramp. Two ten. Laps. Left eight...
I had already started to carry out his last command, but froze like a stone, taking only half a step. Didn't even put my foot on the ground.
- Left eight, - Patogenic repeated just in case, though he had already realized that I was slowing down for a reason.
I very slowly, gently put my foot down. Nothing terrible happened. I stared intensely at the patch of land directly in front of me, overgrown with tall, ugly curved timothy. It was quite indistinguishable from the neighboring ones. Finding nothing of note, I began to turn my head around, trying to spot a close contact pair or some indication of another anomaly. To no avail.
However, where did this creepy, almost physiological reluctance to go forward come from? To the right, please. To the left ... no, I will not go to the left, there is a powerful gravikontsentrats: dragged to him and flatten on the ground, before you have time to squeak. Back - also undesirable: not a stalker to return the same way he came, almost certainly you'll get killed. In short, go ahead and don't worry...
No, I can't.
I took a bolt from my breast pocket and threw it in front of me. The bolt jammed into the wet clay. No, of course it wasn't gravel, not even greed - just wet clay. That's it, the dog, it's stuck...
- Are you sure there's nothing there? - I asked in a strangled voice.
- It was clear by three meters, - Patogenych answered confidently. - What is it, brother, spit?
The old veteran knew better than anyone else that a stalker's intuition must not be disregarded. Maybe his subconscious was just playing tricks, maybe it was guarding him against very real dangers, undetectable otherwise.
- And it's wobbling," I said in a huff.
- Nine-twelve," Pathogenic plotted a new route without hesitation.
I moved to the right, cursing my intuition. If it hadn't, I would have been at the farm gate in a dozen steps.
Or maybe I would be lying in the same place now, shot through with a powerful electric shock. No, not him to the monks, it is better to go slowly, roundabout, but more surely.
At one time stalker clans tried to use in the Zone special engineer robots - such remotely controlled toys with great success demine unexploded ammunition in hot spots and mines of terrorists. But this fashion quickly passed when several outrageously expensive robots were lost on the flat. The operator at a safe distance sees through a special camera and telemetry sensors what the machine sees, but too many parameters remain out of sight - a sudden whiff of hot wind, a strange tingling sensation in his fingertips, an icy needle plunging into the back of his head, a subtle stalker's hunch that does not extend to an iron thing full of electronics.
I wandered through the labyrinth of anomalies for another five minutes, until at last a new safe path led me straight to the wide-open gate of the barn. Cautiously looking inside, I carefully examined the room, automatically noting that not far from the entrance to the right wall sits a flesh-eating mushroom nevidimika.
The barn resembled a long hangar or an empty warehouse, divided by wooden and metal barriers into rows of pens for the animals. The feeders in the stalls were rusted to the ground, and the silage inside had become a lumpy, rocky mass. A breeze lazed through broken windows, a leaky roof, and an imposing breach in the wall. Inside it was bright enough that I was able to make out a few gravelly puddles that had pulled down and pressed remnants of straw into the concrete floor. The nearer fences were visibly bent in their direction.
Well, there you go. A quarter of the job done.
The combination of anomalous fields of interest was located at the far end of the barn. There's nothing to be done. If a valuable artifact has even the slightest chance of ending up in the most inconvenient and dangerous place, then that is where it will end up, you can be sure. I didn't even get upset about it, because I knew from the very beginning that it would.
At the entrance I had to perform an almost circus trick. The doorway was blocked by a small grav concentrate and a meat grinder, leaving a gap about thirty centimetres wide between them. Pathogenic led me to the starting position, I marked the boundaries of the anomalies with bolts, and then sideways, sucking in my stomach, moved between them in tiny treadmill steps. The situation was aggravated by the long strands of rusty hair that came down from the doorway; I had to duck to avoid catching them with my head. The meat grinder flickered behind me as I squeezed dangerously close to it, but I guess I wasn't close enough for a full discharge.
It took me about twenty minutes to get to the far end of the room, though the distance was only about forty paces. I had to circle in one place for a long time, obeying Patogenic's commands, climbing over barriers, squeezing through the narrow gaps between the deadly areas. At one point I even climbed a couple of metres on my hands, clinging to a low overhanging ceiling beam and propping my legs up - a horizontally oriented fryer could hit me with a jet of flame from below.
In the far corner was a dried-out, almost mummified corpse of pseudo-flesh, and in front of it lay a pile of huge, clean-cut bones-I think cow bones, because large mutant bones are much more bizarrely shaped. One bone was sticking out of the shriveled mouth of the pseudo-flesh. I don't know if the animals were evacuated from here after the first crash. Unlikely - there was barely enough transport to get people out. So the poor cows were left here. Their decomposing carcasses were hardly lying around until the second explosion to fall prey to mutants, after all, twenty years had passed from then to now, and forty years to now - so they had gone to the stray dogs as early as the last century. Or rather, they were removed after the first accident by special teams of liquidators, who built a large graveyard not far from the abandoned cattle-breeding complex, which four decades later was dug up and ravaged by blind dogs - that's where these bones are from.
For the pseudo-flesh, the barn has become a death trap. You can't get enough of bare, hard bones. It must have got here during another emission - maybe by accident, maybe it was trying to hide. I don't know if mutants hide from the mutants like humans, or if it's like a light summer rain for them. No one knows that, I'm afraid. At least, there are no fools to crawl out during this local cataclysm and watch, and those who do dare to crawl out will never tell anyone anything. In any case, after the anomalies have changed location, new traps have sprung up in previously clean areas, and the pseudo-drapes have been trapped in this cursed barn. Pseudoblasts are very sentient and cautious creatures, unlike dogs, they very rarely enter anomalies, and if this one did not smell a return passage in an almost solid anomalous field, then there was none for it. Where I had squeezed my way sideways into the deadly anomalies, a pseudo-droid twice my size could not. The creature waited a long time for the passage to finally open, before it finally starved to death.
I wiggled my head cautiously. There it was. Two large meat grinders, fused at the sides, visible even to the naked eye. To the side a dusty spiral of a bird carousel lazily spirals. A little further away is a trampoline, closer to me a medium-sized gravity concentrator. It is all concentrated in a tiny patch of space, all this multi-headed hydra breathing, pulsating and waiting for the idiot to come closer. And generating a unique anomalous field capable of generating a precious artefact.
- We've arrived at the location! - came Patogenic's shriek from outside, confirming my hunch.
I raised my head and squinted my eyes and scrutinized the roof and ceiling beams. The Devil's Egg has a negative weight, so you should look for it under the roofs of dilapidated buildings, under basement ceilings, in the dense treetops that prevent it from soaring into the sky. This probably explains the extreme rarity of deviled eggs: most of them, once created, simply fall upwards and disappear forever into outer space.
No, there's nothing to be seen.
However, from this spot I could only see part of the roof crossed by diagonal beams. I informed my partner that I needed to circle the area, took a few more steps, obeying the commands of the invisible Patogenic through the window: "Corner seven, wait, right three, four twelve!" - and approached the corpse of the pseudo-flesh, meticulously examining the undulating slate surface above his head.
Whereupon the dead mutant's right eye, seemingly forever bulging in death agony, twitched and stared at me...</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_faction_mar_b9_doc_9">
	<text>Soon I regained my ability to move. Now, however, I had nowhere to go. I had lost Dinka again, lost her for the third time in the last twenty-four hours, and for what seemed like forever. The swordsman was going to turn her into the kind of creature he was, and I sat there with one knife in the Redwoods with no power, nothing I could do about it. Except to slit my own throat, so that the monstrous grief would no longer be driven into my brain by a jagged red-hot screw.
No. There are no stalemates in principle. There is no fucking stalemate, Dima Shukhov, you fucking traitor! Your immortal aphorism has always been useful to me, even when four years ago in the Hollow Hills, even when the "tourists" and I were asleep in the catacombs of the Dark Valley after the explosion of a powerful deep-vacuum munition, even when we were ambushed by bandits in the Wildlands and it seemed that we had a complete and utter failure. Why am I now, finally, for the first time in my stalker career, caught in a hopeless situation when there is absolutely no danger to my life? Why are you doing this to me, Dima, Dima...
By the way, what were you saying about corn, you black bastard?
I slowly rose from the ground, not taking my eyes off the dark green island, which suddenly caught my eye in the middle of the red and brown surroundings.
Black Stalker, by the way, made perfect sense. He'd saved me more than once before-and he'd saved me this time, too. Because if Dinka and I hadn't been able to get into the bunker, we would have been looking for another way out. Maybe we would have decided to sit in the well for a while, to avoid being caught by the monoliths occupying the building. In short, I would be finished off either right there in the well, or upstairs, if we did make it to the top. Entering the bunker was my only chance of survival, and that chance had worked. Black Stalker tried to save my life - and as a result he made sure that I brought Dinka to the Swordsman myself and handed her over to her loving daddy hand in hand. Now I understand why Dima was acting so strange when he came out at night to Gus and me to the fire - he already knew that either Dinka was destined to join the masters of the Zone, or I will die. Shukhov must have realised that the first option would be worse for me than death, and therefore he was so reluctant to share the code for the electronic lock of the bunker. However, he apparently saw no other way out.
In short, Black Stalker betrayed me, sneakily and completely. Burn in your icy hell, scum.
He did say something about corn, though. That I shouldn't go where a blind dog wouldn't put his dick. Curious, curious...
A small patch of tall, ugly corn was at the very edge of the Redwood Forest. I don't know where it came from - perhaps, some Pripyat resident had set up a garden plot for himself outside the city some time ago. It seems, at that time it was terribly fashionable and was called either squat or fazenda. I cannot say that the gardener chose the right place for it, but the Soviet people, they say, were extremely indifferent to their own health and future. A whole nation of stalkers, that is. Or maybe the situation is much simpler, and the half-digested seeds were brought in the stomachs of rats or crows. Over the years the corn on the property has mutated and grown into an impenetrable thicket. That's where Red Shukhov advised me not to go. Which means that's where I'm going. Because he's already fooled me once, and now I'm going to do the opposite.
No, I guess he did leave me some chance to try and change things. "How can you talk me out of it?" - that's what he said. There's something about that corn that will still let me fight. An underground passage leading back to the Swordsman's bunker? A single-seat helicopter? A Monolith cache with a set of protective equipment that would allow me to cross the Radar kill zone safely? Black Stalker had made it clear to me that using this thing would be extremely risky, but he still left me one last tiny chance. Because otherwise it's not fair. Because otherwise there's no freedom of choice and I'm just a puppet in his hands, and that's something I wouldn't forgive even the Black Stalker. He did give me the choice to leave without Dinka, or die trying to save her. I frantically crashed through the tangled branches and leaves of the giant ugly corn, chopping furiously with my knife, shoving the unyielding trunks aside, scrambling through the thicket like a wounded bear through old thickets, frantically looking around for where? Where is the damn thing I should never have gone into the corn for? Where is it...?
And then suddenly I saw it - when in the heat of the moment I was about to run into the middle of it. And I stopped dead in my tracks.
Black Stalker's sense of humor is black, too. As black as can be. Black as a devil's keeper.
I slowly approached the thing almost up close and stopped, silently staring at the sparkling anthracite shimmer on the huge green stem. It looked as if someone had emptied a half-liter jug of tar into the corn, the viscous liquid slowly trickled down, and soon solidified into thick oily streaks and weightless cobwebs that gleamed in the light like Dinka's black eyes. Anyone who ventures through the thicket will be caught in the net, a tricky thing. It is especially dangerous at night. It is better not to touch anything in the dark - if the invisible mushroom does not snatch your fingers, you will fly into the web of devil's keeper or the blue tin. Luckily, the sight of this black, sticky creature is nowhere to be found, as the old-timers say it used to be found all over the trees in Militar and the Dark Vale. At first many of the wanderers picked up the Mental Backstabber through it, some even liked it at first, but only Stalker Ghost managed to survive with it. If you can call that living, of course.
I wonder if anyone else besides Ghost has ever thought of voluntarily falling in with a guardian devil in order to resolve a hopeless situation. They say it's far worse than death. I take it it's roughly the same as selling your soul to the real devil. At least, I've never heard of such cases. Of course, a person who has met the devil's keeper acquires tremendous advantages, and one acquires good luck in everything, from artifact hunting to choosing a safe road; but all that luck is outweighed by the fact that one cannot gain any benefit from it. A trail of accidental deaths follows him, and he becomes an outcast. Everybody panically avoids him as contagious, as infected with brown, because everybody who exchanges a few words with him, who touches him, who gets a wink or who calls him by name, dies within a few hours - from an accident, from a suddenly discovered incurable disease, from a bullet, from poisoning by punk vodka... He will not be able to sell his loot to anyone, because anyone who touches the artefacts he loots or tries to resell them will die. He won't be able to buy weapons or equipment because anyone who sells him anything will die. He will not be able to get food or medicine, he will not be able to sleep in a Stalker bar, he will not be able to get vital information - there will be no fools to help him. Nor will he be able to leave the Perimeter - and probably not by accident, just because the devil keeper does not release his victims from the contaminated territory from which he receives an energy boost... And after a while he will go mad and disappear without a trace in the Zone.
The military have most likely already tried to use the mental recluse for their purposes, but since so many years have passed and no army development in this direction has yet been heard of, I think the experiments have failed. The devil keeper indiscriminately destroys everyone with whom his ward has even indirect contact, be they casual acquaintances, lab technicians or the superpower's top generals. I suppose the price seems excessive to them. And good riddance.
I slowly lowered myself to the ground, crossing my legs in the Turkish way. I squinted my eyes and looked up at the black blot of fringed cobwebs fluttering in the wind over my head. He clenched his throbbing temples with his palms.
Here's your chance, stalker. Here it is, the real alternative. Get in the crap, and the insane physical laws of the Zone will be on your side. You'll go through Radar's coverage area without any protective devices. You'll scatter a squad of monoliths in exoskeletons and with gauss rifles with your bare hands. You will take the Swordsman by the throat and save the beloved. But you won't be able to get out of the Zone. In a couple of days you will go mad from the continuous luck and will disappear somewhere in the Wilderness or the Valley of Death, like dozens of other poor souls who were there before you...
I had my own theory about where the lucky ones went. After all, if they continued to be so fabulously lucky as before, they could walk around the Zone indefinitely, successfully finding food and medical kits in other people's hiding places or pulling them out of the backpacks of dead stalkers. But vagrants with a mental backstabber behind their shoulders disappear because such good fortune cannot last forever. It is possible that, having pumped a certain amount of other people's luck and having redirected it to his master, the guardian devil at some point reverses the sign and begins to attract misfortune with terrible force. And then the yesterday's lucky man slips on a level place, breaks his leg, catches his eye on a sharp bough, trying to rise, hits a springboard, breaks his back, crawls forward stubbornly, feeling the sharp teeth of rats from the ruins digging into his legs, keeping the course straight into the invisible sun... So not even a corpse remains of them - because pathological bad luck continues to haunt the devil's master keeper even after death. The tormented corpse is slashed by lightning, torn to pieces by hungry dogs, ground to shreds by wandering anomalies... And who knows, maybe when you once again get incredibly lucky, when you get away alive from marauders, when a chimera runs past without interest in your person, when a damn egg, instead of killing you on the spot, obediently dives into an artifact container, - Isn't that because somewhere nearby in the bushes lies the hidden corpse of an ex-lucky boy, whose posthumous luck the devil keeper sitting on his shoulders persists in redirecting to everyone who happens to be in the vicinity? ..
I leisurely rose from the ground. I rubbed my instantly cold palms together. I stepped to the black blot of devil keeper, almost sinking my face into it. No, nothing special: mold and mildew. Black, greasy, nasty looking. Slowly and cautiously I reached out to it. For a moment, I thought the black stuff moved, moved toward my fingers. But it was probably just the wind...
Lowering my hand, I stepped resolutely forward, ripping the black stain of infernal mold with a quiet crack. Unkempt chunks of cobwebs hung from my jacket. The body desperately resisted the mind pushing it into suicidal action. Blood rushed to my face, my legs refused to obey, an icy stream of liquid nitrogen suddenly rippled up my spine from below as I turned around and plunged backwards into the thicket of corn, glued by the deadly mould of luck, for good measure. It was like that movie where one scuba diver had to descend to ultra-deep water: his lungs would inevitably be flattened at that pressure, so he had to fill them with an oxygen-over-saturated, incompressible liquid. This couldn't do any harm, but the body unambiguously regarded the water in his lungs as a lethal threat, and for a while after the fluid was ingested the diver agonized painfully until his subconscious came to the conclusion that all was well and calmed down. Something similar was happening to me now - I felt no external impact, no pain or discomfort, but my body was going crazy, demanding an immediate end to this mockery. A cold sweat broke out all over my body, my stomach clenched tightly, my throat felt frantic, as if it were an overabundance of adrenaline. My body protested, refusing to die a horrible death, even if it was only supposed to happen a few days later. But I was killing myself right now, in those awful moments.
I turned again to face the devil keeper torn apart, crumbling from the cornstalks to the ground. My breathing was gradually coming back to normal, my ears were no longer burning hotly, the nausea was no longer rushing up my throat in jerks. I wondered if that was enough. Would this stuff get in through clothing and protective coveralls...?
To be on the safe side, I scooped up some of the black mould and quickly rubbed it in my palms, as if I were washing my hands with soap and water. I smeared the edge of my hand across my neck in disgust. Now, that was for sure. The sludge stuck to my palms like fuel oil, and both hands itched like it was just a psychosomatic reaction. I knew from the stories of the old men that the devil keeper himself felt absolutely nothing.
I broke out of the corn bushes with a bang, climbed the hill, looked in the direction of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Closing my eyes, I threw my head back, exposed my face to the autumn wind. I wonder, will it take some time for the Devil Keeper to work, or he is already behind me? However, I have no time to wait anyway, it is now counting in minutes. If it hasn't worked yet, Black Stalker is with him. It would be a lot less painful.
I descended the hill and moved towards the edge of the Radar-scorched space.
The devil keeper had already saddled me. At least, it looked like it, because Radar was silent - I didn't feel the slightest discomfort, not the slightest sign of a brainwave. Maybe the brainiac had broken down unexpectedly, or overheated, or maybe it was just about time for another ten minutes on duty to cool the system down or do some preventive maintenance. The body was silent, too, apparently tired of reacting in vain to the deadly danger for the day. I walked briskly across the black earth, blowing up miniature clouds of gray ash, and I didn't care about anything. I was following Dinka, and no freak could stop me now.
A sniper's bullet struck the ground directly in front of me, scattering the wet turf far away. My body immediately woke up and screamed that I should immediately fall backwards, but I clenched my teeth and stubbornly kept on walking. Either the devil keeper would fix the problem on his own, without my involvement, or I would get a bullet in the head and this crazy day would finally be over. Both options were good enough for me.
The second bullet shrieked ahead of me, after which the sniper fell silent. There could have been any number of reasons for that, too, from unforeseen weapon failure to a sudden heart attack. There are so many ridiculous accidents in life.
I moved resolutely forward. I had no thoughts at all in my head, no plans - for example, how I should break through the triple barbed-wire fence, how to find the entrance to the Swordsman's bunker, how to break into that fortress with its iron hermetic doors. Let the guardian devil have his head about it all. I had sacrificed myself to him, and that was no small price to pay, so let him work it off.
I crossed the scorched space and headed towards the barbed-wire fence. There were a few monoliths roaming the area on the other side, with several more sentries stationed in towers at the corners of the wire-fenced perimeter. Perfect. Without hiding, I moved at full height towards the gate.
The monoliths wasted no time in shouting and firing warning shots in the air. The machine gunners in the towers immediately pointed their cannons in my direction. However, two of the towers did not fire - one in the line of fire was obstructed by the roof of a two-storey administration building, and something had happened to the gunner on the other - at least as I advanced towards the fence, he did not move or change his posture. I think he could do with a doctor.
The machine gun in the tower closest to me only managed to fire one short burst, well above my head, and then its barrel shattered with a rumble, crippling the gunner with shrapnel. The other machine-gunner fired twice, and then he, too, was silent and rummaging about with his stalled weapon; I would not have been surprised to hear that he had carelessly brought an almost empty ammunition magazine into the guardhouse.
The patrolmen on the grounds, meanwhile, had prepared to fire their gausses. One of them could not see me well through the triple row of brambles, so he stepped off the beaten path along the fence and stuck the long barrel of his rifle between the wires. It was a mistake, because with the aiming device he caught the stretch of an anti-personnel mine on the outer row of the fence. The explosion threw him on his back and the barbed wire in all three rows fell off at once, creating a gap big enough for a man to pass through: the mine fragments were so well-dispersed that they split the barbed wire fence in several places. That was understandable; today was my day.
I steered to the resulting passageway and walked straight through the minefield in front of the security perimeter, quite sure that no matter where I stepped, there would be a mine-free space. One of the monoliths tried to shoot at me, but at the last moment, before the shot was fired, he stumbled backwards, jerked the barrel of his rifle, and shot an armor-piercing bullet into the polarized visor of his colleague's helmet. Another man dropped his Gauss and fell to his knees, helplessly scraping his gloved fingers across his chest and helmet - I don't know what happened to him. Anyway, I got through the wire fence unhindered.
Behind the fence reigned the usual chaos of an abandoned construction site for the upper levels of the Zone. There were stacks of concrete channels, like the ones used to build the roadblock in the scorched area. Steel pipes of various diameters were piled everywhere. Concrete air ducts peeked out of the ground; cables and radio masts protruded from unnaturally shaped hills covered by steel plates and rectangular manholes. In this jumble it was impossible to find the entrance to the bunker.
As if in answer to my thoughts, a hatch in the side of one of the hills flung open and a young soldier in SSP without helmet or weapon peered out fearfully. I immediately staggered towards him. He hurriedly slammed the hatch when he saw me, but it did not close all the way; there was something hard between the hinges. When I reached the door of the bunker, and threw open the hatch, the lad was gone; he had escaped into the inner rooms. Well, sit tight, brother, and you probably won't get hurt. And pray, if you raised the alarm.
I walked indifferently down the concrete stairs past the soundly sleeping guard. The other was nowhere to be seen - probably suffering from diarrhea in the toilet. There was no need to give me further directions; I remembered the corridor, through which I had been dragged by two monolithic bastards, well enough. All the doors I passed by in the corridor were either locked or tightly covered, to prevent the monoliths in the bunker from noticing me before I got there. Surely, each of them had some super-urgent and super-important business to attend to. Well, that's wise. As one ostrich says, do what you must, and then we shall see who has the biggest ace up his sleeve.
Suddenly a worrying thought occurred to me. When exactly will the devil backfire and bring numerous misfortunes down on my head? Could it be that the amount of luck he gives to his master is always the same, so if I spend it quickly, generously, on a global scale, far beyond what the theory of probability suggests - say, if I forced him to turn off the Radar or help me penetrate a fortified bunker - could it be that the luck I had received would be exhausted much faster than if I used it to search for trifling artefacts? To be on the safe side, I had to assume that I had not days, but hours, maybe even minutes.
One of the monoliths, who had been dragging me from here half an hour before, suddenly stood in my way, coming out of a side corridor by the door to the tank-room. He seemed to be the one who had spoken to me through the Swordsman. I don't bloody know if it was him - he was wearing a helmet at the time, and I could be mistaken.
- Stay where you are," he commanded, pointing the Fort at me.
Instead of answering, I showed him my black-moulded hands, and he seemed to get the point. At least something had changed in his eyes, and he wasted no more time in talking and rapidly squeezed the trigger five times. And five times in a row it misfired quite accidentally. It was a good pistol, the Forth, but unreliable compared to its counterparts. The cartridges in the barrel sometimes twist.
I didn't wait to see how the devil's keeper would rid me of the nuisance this time. The amount of luck available to me might indeed be limited, and I should not have been careless in wasting it on such trifles. So simultaneously with the sixth misfire my Bowie, snatched lightning-fast from my pocket, sliced my opponent's throat. With a desperate wheeze, the monolith jerked back, and I carefully took the gun from his upturned hand.
Slipping the knife into my pocket and pushing the fresh corpse aside, I unscrewed the hinge of the door and pulled it towards me.
- Hello again," I said, stepping over the high threshold and raising my gun.
Both metal cylinders were ajar. In one of them lay my Dinka, looking at me with wide eyes. Eduard Borisovich was standing beside the metal cabinet, flicking the toggle switches.
- Stand back," I said. - Hands at your sides, scum. Quickly!
- Ah, he's back already. Quickly. - The swordsman cast a short glance over his shoulder at me. - I see, I see. Got into the devil of a keeper, the fool. Well done, clever fellow. One little thing you hadn't counted: I'm one of the Hosts of the Zone! - He turned to me, with a guilty smile shrugged his shoulders: like, see, how it all turned out? - I decide how things should be done here. I determine how the guardian devil must work, you know? The physical laws of your world don't apply in my presence. Or rather, I determine whether they do or not, it is my choice and my sacred desire. Do you understand, vagabond?
- You don't determine a damn thing, you buffoon," I said. - Well, let's make a tenner bet: will it shoot or not now that the worldwide law of meanness is working against your telekinesis? It's about time some beauty got out of that box and said goodbye to Daddy.
- You're a fool, Hemul," said Dinka's papa regretfully. - You could have had a lot of things. You'll end up losing even the little you already had.
- I think you read too many American detectives when you were a kid," I said, keeping the muzzle of my gun on him. I leaned over to the side of the cylinder with Dinka, and began carefully pulling the wires from its headboard, lest at the last moment it should occur to Baichurin to run his infernal machine at the cost of his own life. - You speak in some Hollywood clich?...
The heavy glass lid of the tank suddenly collapsed from above, hitting me on the head and shoulders with force. Still, Daddy wasn't at all sure if he could stop the bullet fired by the master of the guardian devil, so he tried to secure himself in another way.
"Fort" knocked out of my hand and fell inside the glass and metal sarcophagus.
I felt my heart being clenched again by a merciless hand. Only this time the grip was not gentle, but deadly. I gulped for air with my mouth wide open, my eyes flashed in bloody circles, crossed by a wavy line of fire, but at that moment something cracked loudly and burst into the metal cabinet behind my adversary. He rushed over there in a panic and started flicking the tumblers again, leaving me alone. The devil keeper continued to protect me.
Rising from the floor, I drew my knife. My keeper and I were not about to leave my adversary alone.
I lunged at him from behind, defying all notions of a noble duel and a fair fight. He caught my movement, however, and met me with a crushing mental blow. I crouched on the floor again, but he could not finish me off again - with a crash, the metal mount of one of the lamps under the ceiling burst, and pieces of iron fittings and glass shattered on the Swordsman who barely had time to cover his head with his hands. I immediately rolled back to the side, trying to recover myself and at the same time find a position for another attack.
It looked like the odds were stacked against me. I couldn't get the Swordsman with a knife, and the devil keeper wouldn't let him kill me. Pat.
Breathing heavily, we stood in different corners of the room, staring at each other furtively. We seemed to realize at the same time that the situation was a dead end.
- I think we should discuss it," said Borisych softly. - Perhaps I do want too much, demand too much. What if we come to a reasonable, mutually beneficial compromise, which would allow each side...
He talked and talked, and with every word he said, I felt more and more keenly that he was talking my ear off. That he needed to buy some time for something. But what he was trying to do, I could not understand.
I only began to understand it when I moved forward again, and an invisible force lifted me off the floor and pressed me against the opposite wall.
- Well, that's it," smiled the Swordsman kindly. - Aye, that's all I had to do to get your hacker under control. Half a minute's time. You ain't got no more luck, that's all. - He pointed his little finger at me, and I felt a heavy slap, which made my head jerk sharply to the right. - Puppy. Well, what was that all about? - A new slap in the distance, from the other side. A warm stream of water flowed briskly from my nose. - Do you need this, son-in-law? I certainly don't need it. It gives me no pleasure whatsoever..." My left arm began to twist out of its joint pouch, and I hissed in pain.
The damned sorcerer crucified me on the wall and slowly, with relish, twisted my limbs, pinched my arteries and capillaries, jammed thin needles of pain into my nerve nodes. He forgot about everything in the world: that he was a supreme being, that his daughter was in the room, that he was savagely torturing his own, so to speak, son-in-law. I blacked out several times in blinding pain, but the Swordsman immediately brought me to my senses. He was saying something, but I couldn't hear anything through the growing rumble in my ears. He was standing there with his head tilted back, staring at me with his huge Dinky eyes, enjoying my helplessness and my torment. I struggled to get out of his invisible grip, but it was too uneven; it felt like I was pinned against the wall with a giant lump of clay, so that I could barely breathe.
It went on for a long, long time. Possibly several millennia. It went on until suddenly there was the rumble of a pistol shot, my executioner rolled over onto his back, and I myself fell down the wall.
While Swordsman was torturing me, Dinka picked up the monolith's pistol, which was lying in her crystal coffin, and decided the outcome of the duel in her own way. Fort is a good thing, after all: it can easily work even after six successive misfires.
Borisych lay motionless on the floor in a pool of his own blood and brains. He should not have spread his fingers so wide. Decided that Dinka's opinion was not to be asked, that he could solve everything for her. In vain. In the decade and a half since they had seen each other, his Worm had grown sharp claws and teeth. And an opinion of his own the size of a three-story house.
The gun fell out of her hand, and I heard it clatter muffled against the cement floor...</text>

    <text>...Olga awoke again from the cold depths of sleep, but she did not open her eyes. What was the point? To fall asleep again anyway. And to dream again on a given theme. A theme set six years ago, but not yet "solved" by anyone. Not even Olga. Although she better than anyone else knew the answer to the main question: where in the Zone mutants? From there. From Chernobyl and the nearest settlements to the Zone. The outbreak of the Second Catastrophe was special. All subsequent outbreaks were and are of a different nature. Now it is simply a radiation and light show accompanying a gravitational Ejection. Dead Noon, as the stalkers put it. Back then, noon was Anomalous. The flash easily and effortlessly (as if it were just repainting the fenceposts) turned people into monsters, into zombies, and for the lucky ones, into hidden mutants like Olga herself.
"Lucky? - Olga sighed. - 'Hardly. I certainly got off easy, just got a lasting disgust with both the Zone and the outside world. Forced to suffer now, unable both to live in the Zone and to leave it. And as compensation for such suffering - resistance to hypnosis and abnormalities, but these are only proven, proven abnormalities. How many of them do I really have? And how bad are they? What if I just haven't yet gotten into a situation where the monster inside me wants to break out?"
Olga opened her eyes again involuntarily and sat up abruptly on the bed. The prolonged sound repeated itself. Now she knew exactly what that sound was. A floorboard in the corridor had sagged under someone else's foot.
Olga hurriedly fumbled for overalls, quickly pulled on her clothes, slipped her bare feet into her boots, and dug out the automatic from under the bed. Carefully, trying not to make any noise, she approached the door and stood to the left of the opening. She managed to move the frayed lever on the firearm's translator with barely a click.
- I'll shoot you," someone muttered behind the door.
The voice was vaguely familiar. Olga had heard it recently, but hardly more than once or twice. She tried to remember, but failed.
- Who is it? - Olga found nothing better to do than ask.
- Major Brazhnikov, special detachment of the D-3 base. General Ostapenko invites you, madam, to see him. There's a case. Refusal is not accepted. So put on your ladies' things and go out. Leave your machine gun at home.
- ß... - Olga's a little confused. - Wait, um... I'll... tidy myself up.
- That's what I'm talking about, - approvingly muttered Brazhnikov. - Just in case, Olya, bear in mind: my soldiers are under the window. Upstairs and at the back door too. All in all you have five minutes. Time is running out.
There's a short squeak outside the door. It seemed that the punctual Brazhnikov had indeed started a stopwatch. Olga went to the window and pulled back the curtain. Under the window two of the Special Forces were smoking. One managed to spot the centimetre-long movement of the curtain and waved to Olga.
Olga threw the machine gun on the bed, took off her overalls and began to dress like a human being. If General Ostapenko had sent a group for Olga, it meant a serious matter. Most likely, an exit to the Zone. And there she had to pack with all due care.
Olga glanced at the window. She desperately did not want to get involved with the military again. Nothing good could be expected from the head of counterintelligence of the International Isolation Force. Even if everything turned out well and General Ostapenko really just gave Olga an assignment instead of trading her in for some spy, still either the assignment would be ruinous, or the prize for it would be "brass".
- One minute to go! - Brazhnikov warned.
- Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming," threw Olga irritably.
Except for one minute she had at least one more chance left. It was worth a try. She quickly rolled up the mat by the bed and opened a small hatch in the floor. The floor above Brazhnikov might have really had someone on duty, but the basement was unlikely. There were only two places to enter this basement: Olga's bedroom and a room in one inconspicuous cottage nearly a kilometre to the south.
Olga hung the machine gun behind her back, leaned on the edge of the opening and jumped down into the dungeon... where she was instantly nosed into the damp ground and twisted with wire bindings by two soldiers.
In a minute Olga was back in her bedroom, only bound hand and foot.
- You have no respect, young lady. - Brazhnikov broke off a splinter in place of the broken lock, entered and stopped in front of Olga. - What are you afraid of?
- Ostapenko has promised to hand me over to Interpol, - Olga answered gloomily. - Do I need it?
- 'Put aside your fears. - The Major nodded to the soldiers and Olga was untied. - There is a case of your profile. You need to go to the Zone, and, most importantly, to return back. The rate is decent and the company is not bad.
- What kind of 'good'? - Olga looked at the major suspiciously. - Yours?
- You will see there. - Brazhnikov grinned. - Come up, let's go... You will like it. Fact...</text>

    <text>Nobody likes night calls. The harsh sound scares you, makes your body waste adrenaline, and generally confuses you. And if your nerves are a little frayed or you've got some serious sins on your conscience, night calls can even give you a heart attack.
Andrey Lunev, former mercenary, now a freewalker, aka Old, was not one of the shy ten, but for some time now he too did not like calls. Both night and day calls. After a serious mess with the anomaly "Black Angel", which almost cost the lives of all the inhabitants of the Zone, the mercenary syndicate has canceled the hunt for Andrew. For two months now, Lunev felt relatively at ease. But finally settle down did not allow him professional gut feeling and extensive life experience.
Mercenaries forgave nothing and no one. No matter how many times you hero and savior of the Zone from the hostile intrigues, and have to answer. At one time Lunev betrayed the Syndicate, and for this transgression will sooner or later face punishment. In a year or two, when the wave of popularity of the Old will subside, and the favour of high-ranking military officials will not be so clear, Lunev will have to answer for everything. In addition, apart from the syndicate, Andrei had many enemies among "private individuals". For example, Max Kruger, nicknamed "The Mechanic", who led the hunt for the Old One. For not coping with the task of the syndicate, he also dropped out of the glorious ranks of mercenaries, like a cork of champagne. Or take the members of Kazakevich's clandestine enterprise, which was destroyed with Old's assistance. They are unlikely to forgive Oldy for being left without a very lucrative job. Or the former members of the Black Angel group... Who else would have wanted to put the Old One's head on a spike and toss him deeper into the Zone?
Still, Andrei disliked the calls for another reason. When you're a lone wolf, experienced and skilled, there's basically nothing to worry about. Will the syndicate open a new hunt? Unmoored, gone to the Zone, and there you look, citizens, don't wipe your feet. As for the "privateers", it's quite simple. If someone takes the risk... all the worse for him. Andrew did not consider himself the toughest fighter in the Zone, but also to underestimate their own abilities was not inclined. If the gunner or Swordsman were alive, the retired mercenary Old would be much more worried, but in their absence, the only real danger was the collective strength of the Syndicate and, perhaps, a hit by the state machine. Everything else was something like the threat of a runny nose. It existed, but it was silly to take it seriously.
However, that was the way things had been until about Christmas. Then it suddenly changed. In the life of Andrew again appeared Tatiana, now seriously and for a long time, and it turned out that Lunev has someone to worry about.
The old man fumbled for the phone, rejected the call and carefully released his hand, on which Tanya was sleeping. The picture on the screen told Andrei many things, but above all that the caller would definitely call back. So that the new call would not wake up his friend, Old silently got up and went out into the kitchen.
The caller was in no hurry to call back. Apparently, he gave time to wake up. Andrew was not deceived. It was not a matter of tactfulness of the caller, but of his calculating. It was better to wait five minutes and then talk to a normal thinking person, than to waste time on repetitions and listen to a half-asleep mooing back. The old man turned on the kettle and got instant coffee out of the cupboard. Andrew could have bet a million dollars that there wouldn't be time to brew proper coffee. "The night caller" was General Ostapenko. Automatically this fact meant that "sleep was finished tonight".
The General's sophistication knew no bounds. He called back, as expected by Andrew, exactly five minutes later, but not to Staromu, but to Tatiana. This trick did not please Lunev for two reasons. Firstly, it was too insidious, and secondly, it meant that Ostapenko intended to involve in his new adventure and Tanya, a freelancer of the scientific department of counterintelligence ISI. Okay, if as an expert who will be "ashore" to analyze the facts and evidence collected by Old in the Zone. But what if the general orders her to go to the Zone together with Old? That monster will do just as well. He does not care at all, that Tatiana Sergeyevna, a tall green-eyed brown-haired, beautiful and, amazingly enough, intelligent, is not suited to work in the Zone. The general believed that to achieve high goals (and Ostapenko did not set himself any other) will do any means. He did not blink an eye, sent people to certain death, composed intricate combinations, in which coolly sacrificed "pawns", and forced subordinates to spit on everything: from conscience to safety, just to carry out the job.
In general, nothing good from the redundant call Tatiana could not expect.
The kettle switch clicked, and almost at the same time the latchkey in the bedroom door clicked. In the kitchen, with the phone in hand, appeared a sleepy Tatiana. Squinting against the light, she looked around and sighed.
- Did you get a call, too? - She held back a yawn.
- Five minutes ago. Coffee?
- Chief's manner. - Tanya nodded. - Didn't he say what he wanted?
- What about you?
- I didn't have time to ask, he dropped it.
- Bully. - The old one grinned.
At that moment the phone rang again and Andrew pressed the answer button.
- Gather both of you, I'm waiting in the hangar," Ostapenko ordered briefly and sternly.
- "Hello to you too, good man," grumbled Old grudgingly. - Why now? It is wiser in the morning, don't you know?
- You have more sense in the morning, don't you?" "Insolence aside. - The general softened his tone a little. - Gathering at zero thirty. Field uniform. Over and out.
Andrei turned off the phone and turned it thoughtfully in his hand.
- The general switched to military jargon.
- He is a general, after all. - Tatiana shrugged her shoulders.
- No, usually he expresses himself in a human way. And now, apparently, he is tuning in. Something is going to happen. By the way, he's aware that we're... together now.
- Scout. - Tanya took a sip of coffee and set the cup aside. - Go alone anyway. I'll be ten minutes.
- Are you embarrassed? - Andrei looked at her sideways. - What? My past?
- It's yours, and it's the past. - She reached up and snuggled against the Old Man. - And it's not as horrible as you think.
- I killed for money. - The Old One shook his head.
- No one has the right to judge you, Andrei. No one. Not here in the Zone, anyway. Go, meet me in the hangar...

...The last month of winter in the Zone wasn't much different from the first. And it was almost indistinguishable from late autumn or early spring. Except that the wind blew stronger, and it rained all the time, not all day, but only from morning till noon. But daily. As for temperatures, they never dropped below zero and never rose above ten between December and early March. For lovers of coolness it was paradise.
The old one wasn't one of those lovers. He preferred the September weather. Practically summer, but not as hot. Or rather, not so much like a bathhouse. A warm shower, that's all. From Old's point of view, if it were not for anomalies and mutants, the Zone at this time could be considered the most comfortable place on the planet.
True, in this case hardly anyone would have appreciated its charms. After all, without anomalies there are no artifacts, and without them - stalkers and traders, which, like sheep, were constantly hunted by wolves of all stripes: military, bandits and members of numerous factions. Stalkers mined artifacts, took clients to the Zone, earned other relatively honest ways, the military tried to control them, and bandits and others tried to pinch them. Of course, not everyone liked this, and conflicts often arose between the inhabitants of the Zone. These conflicts were closely monitored by the mercenaries. Anyone who could pay for cheap services of the syndicate, it willingly helped to eliminate the competition and particularly annoying opponents.
In general, gradually the Zone formed an almost natural ecosystem, with its own weather, flora, fauna, population and anomalous features. If you get used to it, or rather - to blend into it, or better yet - to dissolve in it, the Zone was really not such a deadly place. Far from charming, but at least it was livable.
The old one had been in for a long time, and had sunk in firmly, but he hadn't dissolved yet. He still remembered what life outside the Zone was like, and he intended to return to it someday. Someday. And now...
Andrew turned around the corner onto the path to the hangar and almost collided with two men in paramilitary uniforms. One, the larger one, Old knew him well. The second, the smaller one, knew him from afar and could only see him through the telescope. However, in the Zone was not customary to pretend that absolutely do not know who's in front of you, if at least heard about the man from acquaintances. On seeing Andrei, the large acquaintance exhaled noisily and muttered disgruntledly:
- Like a bloodsucker appeared out of fucking nowhere!
- And in the face? - Quietly queried the Old One.
- No, no offense, but that could give you a heart attack! And I still have plans! Hello, Old Man.
- Hello, Bibik. - Andrew shook the big man's hand and looked at his companion. - Hello, Scout.
- Hi, Old. - Scout stared at Andrew with interest. - How do you know me?
- I've seen you in the Zone. I thought that's where you stayed. In the ruins, near the sarcophagus.
- I was. - Scout grinned. - The Monoliths did a lot of damage, but I survived, as you can see. Had to stay in the hospital twice as long as he did (Scout nodded at Bibik), but I'm good to go to work and fight again.
- Good. - The old one pointed to the entrance to the hangar. - This way?
- Where else? - Bibic nodded. - Gathering on alert. Ostapenko called personally. Serious business, it seems, is coming.
The wall of the hangar to the right of the entrance was suddenly illuminated by the lights of an approaching car, from which two soldiers and a civilian were unloaded at a pace. This "face" was familiar to both Old and Bibik.
Old watched as the soldiers led the subject to the door by the arms, then glanced at the driven away car and grinned.
- Olya-la, however! I do not know how serious the case is, but it is a murky one.
- It's always like that with Ostapenko," Scout remarked.
- It's either good or nothing about the boss," said Bibik sternly. - Let's go, before they have told us about it.
- And who is the young lady? - Scout asked, following them.
- Olga, - shortly answered Bibik.
- Is that all?
- That was all.
In the hangar it was bright, dry and clean, as it always is in a military object by the moment of arrival of the high-ranking officials. The two escorts who had delivered Olga stood at the door, and the young lady sat by the far wall of the room at a folding table. Opposite her sat deep in the reading of some papers, the very same high command: General Ostapenko himself. The General glanced at his watch and nodded at the plastic armchairs around the table when he saw the trio.
When Old took one of the chairs it became clear that in addition to the previously seen characters in the hangar there was someone who prefers to remain in the shadows for the time being. The shutters of a glass vestibule in the front left corner were drawn, and behind them someone was evidently hiding. The old man moved his chair slightly so that Bibik was between him and the guardhouse. Not because he was afraid of the sniper, just out of habit.
Ostapenko noticed Stary's move but did not say anything. The General's face remained impenetrable as usual, and his gaze was cold and a little aloof. He looked at the invitees like a chess player at pieces. The only thing that could be guessed from the General's gaze was that in the new game Old was to play the role of a queen, no less. Why not Special Forces Colonel Bibik was still a mystery, but Andrey suspected that the answer would be simple.
- Waiting for someone else? - Old broke the lingering silence.
- Waiting," Ostapenko answered and again deepened his reading of the papers.
Andrei shrugged his shoulders subtly and shifted his gaze to Olga. She tried to look at the table, but, no-no, she squinted at Old.
- Mister General," Scout tried to pick up the banner, "how about some coffee? There ought to be a kettle in the duty room.
- No," Ostapenko said without looking at the stalker. - 'We'll start in a minute.
Olga suddenly looked up, but not at the Old One, but at the chipped Scout. There was obvious interest in her eyes. Andrei was not so much offended by this change in the girl's priorities, but a little intrigued nonetheless. Olga looked at Scout as if she was trying to remember where she had seen him.
All this peeping games were over, as the General had promised, in exactly one minute. Ostapenko carefully folded the papers into a leather folder, glanced at his watch again and cast a disgruntled glance at the hangar door. Exactly at the same second the door opened and Tatiana entered the room.
To her, of course, everyone's attention was drawn. The old simply glanced at her, Ostapenko and Bibik nodded hello, and Olga squinted suspiciously. Scout, on the other hand, studied the lady from head to toe.
- Well," he murmured softly, "something good comes from Moscow too.
- Close the window, - as softly advised Bibik and glanced at Starogo.
Scout rounded his eyes understandingly and was silent.
- So, - not waiting for Tatiana to take one of two empty seats, Ostapenko began, - you all understand that I gathered you in such a strange combination I have for a reason.
- And left a free place also for a reason, - said Andrew.
- Right. - The General stared at the Old One with an examining look. - But before another man takes it, I must ask each of you if you agree to contract a raid into the Zone.
- A deadly raid, you mean? - The Old One clarified.
- Yes. Does it frighten you, Mr. Lunev?
- No, Mr. Ostapenko. - Andrei had no trouble withstanding the general's inquisitive gaze. - I just want us to do without feints, mumblings and empty formalities. You don't need to ask Colonel Bibik and military guide Scout. You order them, and that's that. As for me... give me your mission and I'll think about it. Well, Olga will speak for herself.
- I do not agree," Olga said quietly but firmly.
- You have a simple choice, ma'am," Ostapenko countered no less firmly. - You can either go to the Zone, or to jail. You are wanted for serious articles. I warned you not to go to the frontier, but you did not listen.
- I do not agree! - Olga repeated stubbornly, glaring at the tabletop.
- The question is closed. - The General glanced at Tatiana. - I can't order you, but I persuasively ask...
- Yes, of course. - Tatiana looked guiltily at the Old One. - I am ready.
- I object! - Andrei frowned.
- You haven't heard the introduction yet. - Ostapenko shook his head. - And anyway, you have no right to object, you are not a military man. If you refuse, that's your right. But everyone else will go to the Zone. With or without you!
- I wonder who's going to lead them? You've obviously decided to hold back Bibik. Then who? Scout?
Andrei grinned.
- What am I, second class?! - Scout was indignant, but quickly cooled down when he elbowed Beebick in the side.
- I'll drive," came a whisper from the guardhouse.
The voice was distorted by a booming echo, but Old recognized it anyway and braced himself for trouble.
- Meet someone you don't know," Ostapenko suggested, closely watching Andrei's reaction. - Max Kruger, nicknamed Mechanic. A mercenary, who not so long ago was excommunicated from the syndicate for failing a mission. Failed to take down the Old One.
- 'Quite an application,' Scout grinned, and stared at Andrei with interest as well.
- And what do you want with me, then? - Old managed to hide his emotions and glanced at Ostapenko unkindly.
- You can go to sleep now, I told you. - The general pointed to the door. - The exit is over there.
The old man did not move and did not answer anything. The pause lasted longer than a minute. Considerably longer. But even when, according to all the theatrical canons, it should have ended, Andrew still did not voice his decision. However, Ostapenko's nerves were not weaker than Stary's. He gave no sign of impatience and calmly waited for the former mercenary to mature. The General knew that Andrei would agree. He was one hundred percent sure. And he was not mistaken.
- I agree.
- Good," Ostapenko said in a businesslike tone. - Kruger, tell me. Tatiana Sergeyevna, listen carefully, I will need your comments as an experienced scientist. And yours, Lunev, as the most experienced walker.
- Experienced! - Scout snorted softly. - And bloodthirsty!
- You go with him," whispered Beebick in stalker's ear. - Tired of living?
- Yes I am in the Zone ... There was no Zone yet, and I already ... - Scout paused. - Alright, forget it!
The mechanic glared at Andrew for some time, and he answered the mercenary in the same way. In principle, a silent duel of ex-companions could continue at least until morning, but Kruger still managed to cope with emotions and began to state.
- Not long ago I went to the Zone and came across a strange sector. I will not describe it in detail, you will see. In short, it was the coolest mess I had ever seen in the Zone. The mutants are as bad as can be, as if they were drugged with anabolics, and are wicked as if they had their tails greased with turpentine. The anomalies are three times more powerful than elsewhere, and the artifacts are more serious. The ones in the other sectors are nothing compared to those. I, in short, brought a couple of...
He turned to Ostapenko. The general, as if reluctantly, took out of his pocket a rather large artifact, of the "Stone Flower" type, produced by the anomaly "Trumpet". The thing looked really big and had a special shade of flecks in it. Normally the dots on the mirror-like surface of the artifact were yellow-red, but here the yellow colour looked almost gold. The red had a juicy garnet tone to it.
- The lab studied it," Ostapenko reported. - The protective properties against gravitational anomalies such as Funnel and Carousel are almost doubled. The shielding field effect against small arms is also higher than normal.
- And radioactivity? - Tatiana asked.
- Almost the same as in normal specimens.
- 'Interesting,' said Bibik. - A real darling of the sea and no one has got hold of it yet?
- Can not be a little more detail? - Tatiana asked. - What are mainly anomalies found in the sector where it is located, and what other strange things you have found?
- I did not go deep. - The mechanic shrugged. - Life is more expensive. But there are a lot of strange things, I bet. Flying things, for instance. I've never seen them anywhere else.
- Crows, maybe? - Scout asked.
- You're the crow. - The mechanic looked down at the stalker. - Mutants. They're like controllers, gaunt and toothy, only they fly too. Without wings, they fly. Levitating, if you call it smart.
- Plague! - Scout marveled.
- I've seen one not far from Lelev," said Old. - And Tatiana Sergeyevna even used the services of that airline.
- Yes." Tatiana grimaced at the unpleasant memory. - The four of us were grabbed, almost carried away... somewhere.
- Maybe, in this strange sector? - Bibic suggested.
- No," the Mechanic protested firmly. - That sector is only accessible by foot. Not by air, I've seen. Rooks flew by, but I drove the flesh by the same route, and it entered quietly. And they ate it there, too, calmly. Gannets swooped down like piranhas and ate it in a moment. They're as big as a dog and they're running around... pure cheetahs, man. I barely got away.
- Are there any settlements up there? - Old asked doubtfully.
- Ruins of some kind. - The mechanic glanced sourly at the Old One. - Tushkans live in their cellars. Don't you believe me?
- 'I do, Max,' answered Andrew quietly. - But you haven't said anything special yet. I've met fat mutants in Chernobyl too, and flying creatures in the field near Lelev. As for unusually powerful anomalies... there are plenty of them around Novoshepelic and the greenhouses. The only thing I haven't seen so far is such large "Stone Blossoms", but I have seen something cooler than any usual artefacts.
- "The Joker, for instance," Bibik said, nodding in agreement. - The old man's right: no more water, no more meat. Is there anything really special about this sector?
Andrei and the colonel's questions clearly stumped the mercenary. The mechanic looked questioningly at the general, who redirected the mute question to Tatiana Sergeyevna.
- You did not answer where the sector is located? - Tatiana came to the Mechanic's aid.
- Ah... well... In Chernobyl 2. - Krueger waved his hand indefinitely. - That is, next to him. But you can't go straight to it, you have to make a couple of turns. Well, there's like an invisible path that leads to the place. As you walk along it you can see the entrance to the sector, a step aside - you can't see it. I wandered for a long time before I managed to figure out that path. Took me almost a month to figure it out.
- So much for the strangeness. - Tatiana meaningfully looked at Bibik, and then at Andrew.
- How does the entrance look like? - The old one has not given up yet.
- Yes, almost nothing. Well, the glade is forty meters in diameter and the glow around it, as if the greenish mist goes in a circle. It's about a meter off the ground, and it's translucent... On a sunny day, you probably couldn't even see it.
- Where's a sunny day like that? - Scout grumbled. - How would you see the path?
- You can't. - He turned back into a fiercely confident mercenary. - There it is.
He tapped his thumb on his temple.
- Does it all fit here? - Scout asked ironically.
Kruger said nothing. Instead of answering he looked expressively at the stalker and moved his hand across his throat.
- Gentlemen! - Tatiana interfered. - Stop it! Like children, I swear! Max, can you recall any other strange things? I am not interested in mutants or anomalies, but in strange properties of the area, the sector itself. Does it look migratory or mothballed?
- No, nothing like that. - Krueger paused for a second. - Actually... Anyway, when I went in, I was going north, and when I came out... North, too. I'd been there five times and once I tried coming in from the east, but it was always the same. I looked in which direction I looked when I came in and in which direction I looked when I came out. Weird?
- Very much so. - Tatiana thoughtfully drummed her fingers on the table.
- Oh, rubbish," Scout said indulgently. - It's not weird, it's typical amoebis... or whatever you call it... Loop, plain and simple.
- Mebius-sector? - Tatiana perked up. - Why, it is possible!
- Typical! - Beebik sniggered. - Have you seen a lot of them?
- None. - Scout threw up his hands. - But I've heard a hundred! Lots of guys had wandered into them. The boys talked about fat mutants, and super duper anomalies. Only no one brought such large artifacts.
- That's because it was your boys who told the stories. - Beebick held up his hand, pre-empting Scout's indignant retort. - There's been talk in the Zone about this mythical 'Mebius-sector' for a long time, but it's no use. No one can tell us exactly where it is located.
- Now can," grudgingly muttered Andrei. - General, is that what you wanted to hear?
- Yes, Andrei. - Ostapenko nodded. - You have made the right conclusions, it means that I was not mistaken, you will succeed.
- And what exactly is to work out? Or are you suggesting to guess it yourself? If so, I'll pass.
- Me neither. - Scout folded his arms across his chest and slumped back in his armchair, crawling slightly under the table.
- Olga, maybe you can guess. - The old man glanced at the girl. - Otherwise you keep silent all the time like a fish.
- I don't know what you mean," Olga muttered. - I don't know what you're talking about," Olga grumbled, "and I don't care.
- I can briefly explain, - offered Tatiana.
In her voice she sounded friendly, but Olga did not seem to be touched. Olga was in no hurry to accept the hand outstretched by Tatiana Sergeevna out of a sense of female solidarity. However, Tatiana cool attitude of her future sister in arms did not embarrass her. With the tacit consent of the general, she tore a sheet of paper from a narrow strip and constructed a simple Mobius strip.
- What it is, I think, everyone knows. The sector Max discovered has about the same curvature of space. Simply put, the strange sector is located on the invisible side of the ribbon. But if we go forward, we pass through the invisible sector and... back to the visible part of it, the starting point.
- Facing the same way," interjected Bibik.
- Exactly. Simple!
- Simple," reluctantly agreed Olga. - What's the use? So, the sector, so "Mebius", what next?
- The point is that such a sector cannot be compact. Do you understand?
- No.
- Experts on so-called "territorial anomalies" conditionally divide the Zone into twelve sectors, each of them thirty degrees. Conditionally, because in reality some sectors are slightly larger and others slightly smaller, but the deviations from the pattern are insignificant. All changes, like the migration of certain areas, the formation of new anomalous areas, the opening or closing of certain areas to so-called conservation, take place strictly within the boundaries of their own, i.e. one of those twelve, sectors. Even Limansk's famous migratory sector actually moves exclusively within its "large" sector, one-twelfth of the Zone's total area. It's just that the others move by five kilometres, no more, and this one drifts by up to twenty.
- Now break my brains," Olga gritted through her teeth. - Can't you make it simpler?
- I'm trying. Mebius-sector, by all calculations, cannot be part of any of the twelve large sectors of the Zone. For it could fully live mutants, raging anomalies, and most importantly - in order for it to accumulate a serious amount of anomalous energy, the sector must fully occupy one of the twelve parts of the Zone...
- But all those parts have been studied and it doesn't look like a strange sector, does it? - Olga finally went along with it.
- Exactly! - Tatiana marked a hint of a smile.
- And where is it located, in that case? Underground, like a secret city near Pripyat?
- Hardly.
- It is a question to citizen Mebius, - interfered Bibik. - 'Somewhere. We do not care about details. What is important for us? To designate an entrance and an exit, to study as much as we can what there is "the lost world", and to find out, why the inhabitants of the forbidden sector lately flicker on the screen more often than "the blonde in chocolate". Isn't that right, General?
- That's right, Bibic.
- And there's one more thing to keep in mind," encouraged Bibik. - This sector is, in fact, another anomaly. Which means, like all decent anomalies, it may have artifacts. I suggest you take that into account when you study the sector.
- No objection," Ostapenko agreed again.
- 'Yeah, well, what's there to object to? - Scout grumbled. - It is not for you to plunge your ass into an anomaly.
- You were saying, military guide? - Ostapenko pretended not to hear.
- Always ready, I say. - Scout sighed. - I've been wherever I've been...
- Wherever they sent me, that's where I went," said Bibik.
- That's right. But I sure as hell ain't been sent to another dimension yet.
- It's not exactly another dimension... - Tatiana tried to sit back on her favorite hobbyhorse again.
- Got it, got it! - Scout raised his hands again. - Hidden sector!
- Thirteenth sector, - suggested his version Andrew. - Difficult to reach and extremely anomalous. We need to find out why.
Unlike Scout, who was mainly interested in security issues, or Tatiana, who was mostly concerned with the unusualness of the sector, Lunev understood that in the Thirteenth group of scouts waiting much more mysteries and problems than can imagine walkers now, sitting "on the shore", in a warm hangar. As usual, the general voiced hardly half of what he knew himself. So all the speculations of Old, Bibik and the others did not clarify the real situation at all.
To understand at least a little bit what Ostapenko expected from the raid, Old had to think about all the details, and at the same time remember all the conversations with Ostapenko, which dealt with the Zone and the general's main headaches. For example, a conversation in the bar "Som" that took place immediately after the defeat of the group "Black Angel", when the general admitted that without Andrei most likely will not be able to identify a particularly cunning and dangerous enemy, has long opposed the ISI headquarters and personally General, as head of counterintelligence.
Lunev concentrated and recalled almost verbatim what Ostapenko had said then...... - I have a suspicion that the black angels were not financed from the Big Land at all," Ostapenko said, staring at his glass thoughtfully. - Remember Colonel Dorogin? When he came to his senses he said that Kazakevich had mentioned a whole network of underground laboratories. I don't think this network was run by Kazakevich, nor was the Black Angel group commanded by the Alpha and Beta Angels. But this mysterious puppeteer is not a millionaire from outside the Zone. Besides the general approach to the matter, there is a lot in both stories that people from the Big Earth don't know and don't want to know about. There is a reason for that. 
- Both plots were conceived and planned by one person, and it is someone from the inhabitants of the Zone, I get it right? - said Andrei. 
- An individual or an initiative group - it is not clear yet. With absolute certainty, I can only repeat: adventure has a single handwriting, and they were thought up directly in the Zone. 
- And what are these adventurers trying to achieve? 
- I do not know. Maybe they want to take control of the Zone, or maybe they just want to make a quick and large profit. Actually, that's what I need you to figure out, Lunev. Colonel Bibic says your brain is out of place, but I believe that even if it's out of place, it's in the right direction. And just as much as it takes to be successful in the Zone. Do you get it? 
- You make it sound a bit complicated, but I do get it. Any clues at all? Other than your approach to the case. 
- None. - Ostapenko threw up his hands. - If they were available, I'd have made the case myself, without you. Just theory and logic, that's all we have... 

...Now Andrew realized that that conversation had not forgotten Ostapenko. Especially the phrase about his brains being shifted "as far as necessary". Otherwise he would not have assembled such a motley crew and appointed Old as its leader.
"There's an unconventional approach to unconventional cases, all right."
It didn't follow at all from these reflections that Ostapenko considered the Thirteenth Sector to be the source of all problems. Rather, the general hoped to find in it the very clues, the hints that would help in the investigation of the tangled case of the secret patron of all local adventurers.
"Unless, of course, Ostapenko is mistaken and this patron really exists.
- Don't rack your brains," said Bibik, distracting Andrei from his thoughts. - You will orientate yourself on the spot, it will be more reliable. It's not the first time you've been to the Zone.
Old looked round the group and stopped at Tatiana. She was the weakest link, and it worried Andrew the most. Stary had no hope to change Ostapenko's mind, but a compromise was still possible.
- I need another experienced fighter," said Andrei firmly.
- I knew what you would say, - said Ostapenko a little tired. - Don't count on Bibik. I need the Colonel here at the base. He'll keep his hand on the pulse and bring the cavalry if anything happens, I promise.
- I need a real fighter, not a virtual one!
- Take your pick," the general nodded at the two commandos at the entrance to the hangar. - There's a full base of such eagles.
- General," Old grimaced, "we had a deal, no feints!
- It was you who agreed, - said Ostapenko. - 'All right, let it be 'no feints'. The sixth member of the group will join you later. He's busy right now. And don't look at me like a policeman at a thief. It's gonna be real, as you like to say. Real as can be.
- How's he gonna find us?
- Itinerary's based on the Mechanic's word. Don't deviate and you'll be fine. Any other questions?
- Any restrictions on your choice of weapon?
- None. The entire arsenal is yours. And, Andrei...
The general took out a briefcase from under the table and placed it carefully on the table. He had not yet touched the locks of the case, and Lunev already knew exactly what lay inside. Too solemn and at the same time deliberately dissatisfied was the General's expression. He was clearly violating one of the staff instructions, but did it with a hidden pleasure. As if he was secretly taking revenge on his staff colleagues, who issued stupid orders and wrote useless and sometimes even harmful instructions in the Zone.
- There are five copies here, the sixth will have his own.
- Conscience awakened? - Lunev grinned and took from the case one of the five artifacts of the Joker type.
- Oh!" Scout fussed. - 'That's... it is, isn't it? "The Joker?" I heard a lot about it in the hospital, but I've never seen it before! Does it really protect against all kinds of anomalies and mutants?
- Also protects against bullets and heals wounds in no time," Bibik added. - Even the deadly ones.
- That's cool!
- Don't believe in such stories. - The colonel grinned indulgently and patted Scout on the shoulder.
- Is that a lie? What's with all the glass, then? I'd rather have an extra pack of bullets!
- That's right," said Andrei, "it protects against anomalies, and from anomalies, too. And from anomalies, and from beasts, and even from psi-pulse. I've proved it on my own. But you mustn't relax, and you'd better not go to the anomalies on purpose. He also will deflect the bullets if they come from far away. If it's point-blank range, it'll hit you easy, mind you.
- Neither will it protect you from cold weapons," the Mechanic added, testing the artefact as well. - Not from a shuriken, for instance.
He cast an inquiring glance at the Old Man. He threw up his hands in curiosity. Nothing like that was in his arsenal today. Andrzej intended to use only standard weapons. Although, if you dig well, in the basements of Ostapenko's weapons room you can find anything. From bow to MANPAD, from fus?e to advanced assault rifle and from Swiss folding knife to broadsword. So do katana, shuriken, nunchaku and other Oriental exotics. And that's in the usual three dimensions, with no hidden Mebius sectors.
- Shall we go to the backroom? - Andrey looked at Ostapenko.
- You know the way. You're in command from now on, Lunev. - The general took the documents out of the folder again. - Bibik is coordinating. Exit at six in the morning. All clear.</text>

    <text>No one really knows what telepathy is. A direct connection between two minds, or a mental entry into a special information space and communication with the subscriber's mind through this astral, like through the Internet. Perhaps, the mechanism is fundamentally different and cannot be imagined by an ordinary mind. In any case, the essence of the matter does not change. Especially in the Zone. Here the existence of telepathy is not questioned even by inveterate sceptics. In the Zone, this anomalous, from the point of view of traditional science, phenomenon is not just widespread, it also exists in several modifications.
The most popular - mental control, by which the mutant controllers control people who fall under their influence, certain types of monsters and even those who are theoretically impossible to control - the dead. That is, zombies.
Also telepathic vision is not uncommon, such as Blind Dogs, though many scientists believe that the zoned dogs simply rely on heightened senses and hearing, and that telepathic vision has nothing to do with it.
A third option, even two - the third and fourth - are common among the small but particularly vicious and insidious mutants of the yellow-and-white dwarf species. First, these subterranean creatures have the gift of foresight. They often, without any reconnaissance, set ambushes where, hours later, humans must pass. Second, midgets also have a talent for telekinesis-essentially an aria in the same league as telepathy. Mental effort to lift a large stone and hurl it at an enemy is a piece of cake.
But that's as far as mutants are concerned. People in the Zone are not so panicky about telepathy. Among them there are quite good hypnotists, and beginning telekinetic, but real telepaths are very few, almost none. And those few who are among the "almost" will never admit to their talent in life. If only because their best friends would shoot them on the spot. With this the inhabitants of the Zone, everything is simple and strict. There is an aberration - a mutant, and therefore - a bullet in the forehead.
But who in his right mind (even with an unusual talent) would admit that he is a telepath? Why? It is much more profitable and safer to just live with it and use it to the fullest. Although full is a strong word for it. It's not much of a coil, so you rarely want to use it.
Because here's the tricky thing: it's almost impossible to establish telepathic contact with normal people. You can hypnotize them, scare them, make them move against their will, but you cannot read their thoughts or inspire your own. It's only possible with telepaths, which... see above... very few among humans and many among mutants. And exchanging thoughts with a controller is even stupider than admitting to humans that you are a latent mutant. And also deadly.
- Your yearning to communicate with your own kind is near and understandable to me," came a mental voice.
The start of the telepathic contact was not accompanied by any preliminary special effects. No calls, no pictures in front of my gaze. Just a voice began to sound in my head. Like a madman.
- I'm not pining. It's just that sometimes I wish... not to be alone.
- And I get that. I'm with you, so you're not a loner. You have information. What is it? Just try to keep it short and specific, I don't have much time.
- So do I. Ostapenko's men found the trail. The general has assembled a special group. They're preparing for a raid as we speak.
- A suicide team. - The mental phrase had a tinge of disdain. - The General could send his entire army down the trail, it wouldn't make any difference. Too late.
- There are only five in the group. A little later a sixth should join them. But a small team doesn't mean it's not dangerous. Ostapenko is very cunning. He's very selective.
- You're in the group too, aren't you?
- Yes. And there may be a military cunning in that as well. It's unlikely the general knows about my abilities, but he can guess. And it's probably not the only ace he's got up his sleeve. I suspect at least two other walkers have hidden powers.
- That's funny. But I still don't see anything to worry about. So far, Ostapenko has only won isolated skirmishes on our invisible front. He can't win the whole campaign.
- The group is led by Stary. Personally I don't like this man, I have a feeling there's bound to be problems with him.
- You're exaggerating. This mercenary is no better than any other man.
- By himself, yes. Under Ostapenko's leadership, no. This mercenary's thwarted two major operations for you, hasn't he? First with Zov, then with Black Angel. Where's the guarantee he won't succeed in disrupting a third?
- The new operation is fundamentally different from the previous ones," he paused. - But I think I agree with your misgivings. Is the group able to follow the trail all the way to the entrance?
- Yes. The group leader knows the route well.
- Can they be delayed?
- Not for long. But you'll have to think of something new for that, too. The old one won't be stopped by simple roadblocks.
- All right, I'll send some psionics to meet the group. They'll give Old Man some serious trouble along the way.
- And if the group does make it to the burrow? What will you do?
- You know all too well what Sector Thirteen is. People can't survive in it. Even Old won't walk more than a hundred paces through the sector, our wild brothers will eat him up right at the gate. I won't have to do anything.
- The Old One can just mark the entrance and not go anywhere. He'll call it in on his sat-nav and wait for the cavalry on the doorstep.
- No, if the group gets there, they'll get into the sector, trust me. "The cavalry won't be called in by the Old One.
- I can't see your thoughts - why not?
- Consider me well versed in Ostapenko. If the General really expects to lay out some secret trump cards at the last minute, his men are bound to enter the sector.
- Are you going to let them in?
- Let them come in first, and then we'll see. Forewarned is forearmed. Whatever Ostapenko is up to, we now have the advantage of knowing his secret team is coming.
- If one of the walkers carries a nuclear device in his backpack, the supposed advantage will turn into defeat.
- We'll find out long before the group gets to the hole. That's what you're gonna find out. And my psionics will help you.
- I don't see how I'm gonna find out. Clearly, if someone's carrying too heavy a load, it'll eventually become clear what's in it. But a landmine could bring in a sixth man who's following in our footsteps.
- Think of something. It doesn't matter who carries the bomb, one of the walkers or the sixth. The old one's bound to know the mission objective and the activation code. I don't think he'll tell you the code, but he'll at least let you know the target. All you have to do is build a relationship with him. It's the hardships that bring people together, make them more open, remember that. The psionics will provide the group with those difficulties. All you have to do is ask the right question at the right time. Can you do that?
- Yes, it is.
- Keep me posted.
- I'll try to....</text>

    <text>The tradition of going out on a raid after dark was, in Andrei's opinion, quite sensible. Normally, while the groups were moving through the Frontier and the relatively safe outskirts of the Zone, normal visibility was provided by noctoscopes. And by the time the groups entered the zone deep enough and relying on night vision devices is not safe, covered with eternal clouds, the sky lightened and the problem solved itself.
Usually. But today Lunev sensed that the Zone was preparing some kind of trick right outside the base's gates. Or even in its territory. So the darkness might have played against the walkers.
The group had only just loaded their packs and lined up, and the specter of trouble was already looming in their sights. Near the gate of the staff hangar, about forty meters away, a strange greenish glow miraculously appeared in the small square. Andrew thought at first that the NVA was malfunctioning, but looking with the naked eye he realized that the "malfunction" had another origin. A ring of greenish fog, twenty meters in diameter, drew a perfect circle in the middle of the square. What this anomalous phenomenon was, Old did not guess. It was not his problem. He needed to concentrate on the raid, and minor deviations in the territory of the base should be dealt with by other people. At least the same Bibik.
The colonel was standing with his back to the parade ground, carefully helping the group to check whether all the straps were fastened, and did not see the emerging problem. Andrew nudged Bibik in the shoulder and glanced at the ring of fog.
- What? Oh, that, - Colonel waved his hand, - it happens sometimes in the morning.
- I didn't notice, - said Andrew doubtfully. - Always in the same place?
- No. First time at the base. But I've seen them in some other places. In the Zone and the Borderland. I've even seen one in the Dymer once. Hangs around for an hour, then melts. Harmless stuff.
- Were there any chemical analyses made? - Tatiana intervened.
- No. - Bibik put out his hand to the strap of Olga's unloading. - Here it must be tightened.
- Hands! - Olga took Bibik's claw from her chest.
- In vain you did not, - said Tatiana. - What if it is poisonous gas? Swamp fumes can be very harmful sometimes.
- What makes you think it's fumes? - Bibik took a step back and circled the formation with an attentive look. - A fog like a fog.
- Green? - Tatiana grinned. - Tell me you were too lazy to exert yourself!
- Stand," quietly commanded Andrew, interrupting their argument.
- Stretch we are not too lazy, if only with whom," Scout cheerfully remarked and suddenly slapped Olga from the bottom of the back.
The reaction was instantaneous. She elbowed the funny man in the stomach in such a way that Scout nearly fell on his heel. If Scout hadn't been wearing his bulletproof vest, he would have stood bent over for the rest of the inspection, trying to regain his breath. When the bewildered stalker regained his place in the ranks, he took another beating from Beebeek. The colonel slapped his friend lightly on the forehead with his palm and shook his head reproachfully.
- Think with that place, not with your trousers, you moth!
- What about me? - Scout grinned. - Nothing on me, just making friendly contact.
- Next time I'll break your nose," Olga promised him quietly.
- And I'll help," spat and added the Mechanic unkindly.
- Thank you, I can manage.
- You are evil, - pretended to be offended Scout. - You mustn't go to the Zone in such mood. You must have a positive attitude in your soul, and you have... ...empty. We'll fail the mission with such a mood, you bet we will.
- Is that a positive? - The mechanic gave Scout a devastating look.
- Old one, get this gop-company out of here. - Beebick waved a hand. - Before they tear each other to pieces. Good luck.
- Thank you, Colonel. - Andrei shook Bibik's hand and turned back to the group. - Mechanic first, Scout at the back. Forward march!
The group rearranged into a column one by one and moved towards the north gate of the base. Olga went second just in case. Andrew paused for a second and cast another anxious glance at the greenish ring of mist.
- You'd wait till this trouble disappears, keep an eye out," he threw to Bibik.
- Don't sweat it. - The colonel grinned indulgently. - 'I tell you, it's a familiar thing. Put it out of your mind. You've got so much trouble ahead of you, you'll fill your brain under the cap without that fog.
The old man shrugged his shoulders and followed the group. The colonel was probably right. Andrei should have concentrated as much as possible on his problems, both external, waiting for the group in the Zone, and internal.
For example, Old could bet a hundred against one, that the mechanic volunteered to go to the Thirteenth sector only because he was sure - Ostapenko will send Andrew with him. That is, the mercenary would have a real chance to get even with his former colleague.
Andrew shot a glance at the mechanic stomping ahead. No, before the group reaches the "inner circle", the territory between Chernobyl and Pripyat, Max is unlikely to dare to attack, but keep your eyes open at once - so it is more reliable.
In addition to the Mechanic's revenge, other problems were to be feared. For example, the quarrel between Olga and Scout. What kind of cat flit between them, it was not clear yet, but sparks between them so that just take and light a cigarette. Tatiana Old's loyalty did not bother him, but she remained a weak link in the battle plan, which also promised problems.
Anyway, yes, the colonel was right. Everything unnecessary should simply be put out of his mind.
The old man looked around anxiously once more. The base had already disappeared behind the forest, and this fact put all questions at rest. Now everyone relied on themselves and their closest comrades: Andrey on the group, Bibik on the base's garrison.
The old man increased his pace and approached the Mechanic.
- We veered to the east. - Old nodded at the river gleaming between the trees ahead. - What are you up to?
- Nothing... - Max drew back a branch and glanced up at the river too. - The trail starts there, at the edge of Opacichi. If we go straight northwest, we won't find the entrance to the sector.
- Strange. - Andrew looked at Krueger suspiciously.
- You may not believe that. - The mechanic shrugged his shoulders. - I've tried twenty times. Went both directly and through Stechanka, and tried to come in from the north. It's no use. The entrance is opened only if you start from here and pass through Opachichi, Yampol, Cherevach. And then, before reaching Novoselok, you turn northwest and pass the Krinka Lake and the eastern outskirts of Korogod.
- Through the marsh?
- Yes.
- And then?
- And then strictly northwards, about three kilometres. - The mechanic grinned. - You know that. What, you still don't believe me?
- No, Mechanic, I don't. - Andrew tried to catch Kruger's gaze. - Why'd you suddenly volunteer to help Ostapenko?
- You are out of a job, you have to make a living. - The mechanic hid his eyes. - You have been in that situation yourself. And you are.
- But you're not being hunted by the syndicate. Why not?
- What do you want?! - The mechanic couldn't take it anymore. - To get me to come clean? Fuck you! I have no particular intention. I earn my living the way I know how. And you can thank the general for us being in the same group. I didn't want to meet you either, and I didn't want to go to the Zone!
- You didn't answer about the syndicate.
- Fuck you!" The mechanic strode forward decisively.
- Hey, Old Man, why are you so suspicious, - caught up with Andrew, said softly Scout. - Why should the syndicate want him? To hunt him... Not worth the effort.
- Did someone ask you? - Andrew glanced frowned at the stalker.
- Ah. - Scout waved a hand. - The general picked a group! All individuals, all with character, with guts... Fail the mission! One hundred percent!
- Shut up! - Olga suddenly demanded. - Do you hear?
- What?" Scout turned his head. - Just the wind.
- The cannonade. - Olga held up her index finger and then jabbed steadily in the direction where the base remained.
- Maybe just thunder? - Scout listened.
- No, it's explosions, - confirmed Olga's guess. - I was not mistaken after all. Problems have arisen at the base.
- So, what shall we do now, shall we go back?
- All the more reason to go back now. - The old man shook his head.
- Do you think there is a connection? - Olga pointed first to the south, then to the northwest.
- I don't know yet. - Andrew glanced at Tatiana, but she only shrugged.
- And I know, that if we stand there, we will not find out anything," muttered the Mechanic from the thicket. - Move it!
Scout and Olga looked questioningly at Lunev. He waited a few seconds and then nodded. The mechanic was right. Stalling in one place and scratching their tongues makes no sense.
The group formed a semblance of a formation and moved through an oak grove and towards a long overgrown with young growth dirt road, which once connected the highway Oranoye - Chernobyl - Pripyat (aka R-10) with a lost in the forest village Kamenka. The mechanic navigated the ground well and lead the group to the old road exactly where he should. If Old had walked first, he would have come out of the grove here too.
Two clusters of ruins were black behind and ahead of the group, to the right of the road, a sluggish brook gurgled in a concrete pipe under the road, and a vast swamp with numerous islands on which lean birch trees nestled stretched to the left.
This picturesque spot near Kamenka, at the junction of the tracts Big Circle and Cheremetevo plots, was considered by the walkers a sort of border point between the relatively safe periphery of the Zone and its core area, where dangers and problems began to grow like a snowball. But that was up ahead. Here, in the peculiar neutral strip, for some reason nothing ever happened. No anomalies were formed, no mutants settled in the ruins, and even such irreconcilable factions as the Duty and Freedom put their weapons on the safety lock and continued the interrupted brawl only when they left the two hundred meter stretch of road between the mossy ruins.
The most interesting thing is that no one in the Zone had negotiated exactly such rules of conduct in a strange place near the abandoned village of Kamenka, as well as in other similar places. There were at most five or six of them in the whole Zone, and they covered no more than a hectare in total, but perhaps that was their special value.
Old noticed the apprehension with which Tatiana looks at the nearest ruins, and hurried to encourage her smile.
- It's ok, beasts do not settle here.
- Why?
- Nobody knows, but it is a proven fact.
- It's a clean island," Scout interjected. - It's a good place to spend the night. You sleep like a light sleeper. And there's...
Scout didn't finish the thought, as it was no longer necessary. The lulling tale of a "clean island" suddenly melted away like a morning mist in the sunlight. Four of the five hapless visitors to the "island" clenched their eyes shut and clenched their teeth. At the same time, something like the morning sun flashed before their eyes, and at the same time a sharp pain pierced the heads of the four.
If it had not been for Olga, how this "sunbath for brains" would have ended, it would have been hard to say. Olga was the only one who did not react to the blatant psi attack. Lunev had time to notice this and, despite the pain, managed to remember Olga's immunity to hypnotic influence.
- Kill... that... creature," Andrei ordered through gritted teeth as he struggled to open his eyes. - Find...
- I'm looking! - Olga raised her rifle and set the SPAD to maximum sensitivity.
To find a nestled somewhere nearby controller, or someone who attacked the group via telepathic suggestion, was very difficult. Olga couldn't see him, no matter how hard she tried. Meanwhile, Scout and Tatiana had already collapsed to their knees and began to settle down, almost unconscious from the pain. Andrei and the Mechanic held on, but also at the limit of their strength. Another minute and the group could have shrunk to just Olga alone.
The girl became nervous, irritably pulled off her PNV goggles and suddenly saw the enemy. Or rather, she didn't see, she just realised where he was hiding. She could feel it. Without hesitating another second, Olga turned toward the ruins, raised the scope higher and unloaded the entire magazine on the upper branches of an old oak tree, which loomed over the ruins like a huge umbrella.
The mutant's body tumbled to the ground, slamming resoundingly against the mossy stones of the ruins.
Krueger was knocked out in the same second. Only Andrey and Olga remained on their feet.
- Check it! - Old demanded, writhing in pain.
Olga, changing the magazine as she went over to the corpse of the enemy and made a short burst of control in the head of the mutant.
- Strange creature," she returned and informed Lunev. - A sort of Controller, only bigger and different in appearance. Almost human.
- Almost? - vigorously massaging his temples, asked Andrew.
It was obvious that he was still in pain, the effects of psi-stroke passed slowly.
- Eyes without whites, black as night.
- Seen one of those. - Lunev ran his palm over his face with an effort, then wiped his watery eyes with his sleeve. - Saw one in Chernobyl. They're not just telepaths, they're also telekinetic. That time a similar creature lifted three tons of iron in the air and almost collapsed on our heads. Von, Tatiana was there too.
- I remember," Tatiana confirmed quietly, sitting down on the ground. - But I don't understand... we have the Jokers... why didn't they help?
- Because the Jokers," Scout muttered hoarsely, "work wherever they want.
- Maybe it's because of this clean island? - Tatyana suggested. - Do the other artifacts work here?
- Who approached them? - Scout threw up his hands. - Nobody assaulted anyone here before, there were no anomalies at all. Maybe other artifacts lost power, but no one noticed.
Tatiana rummaged in her pouch and pulled the dosimeter.
- The background is almost zero, strange. Even on the Big Earth this rarely occurs.
- There we go! - Scout waved his hand.
- What, "There"? - Stalker squeezed Olga.
- What, what... an anomaly is the reverse, that's what!
- Here you have it all 'in reverse'. - Olga twiddled her finger at her temple and turned round to the commander. - Old one, there's someone sneaking up behind us. When the controller pinned you down, I heard someone stirring in the woods.
She pointed her machine gun at the thicket of hazel trees to the east of the ruins.
- People," the mechanic added confidently, nodding in the same direction as Olga. - Lots of people. But they won't attack now. A clean island is still in authority for them.
- Yet? - Scout perked up again. - How long for now?
- We don't want to find out," he decided. - Let's go away. Should we go to Kamenka?
- No. The mechanic backed away. - We'll go to the north. The old glade will take us to the cowsheds near Opacichi. That's where the trail starts.
- Let's drive on! - ordered Andrey.
The group formed somehow and moved along the second cluster of ruins. The old man followed close behind, now and then looking behind. The oak woods soon ended and tall, slender pines took the place of the old stout trees. While this was advantageous in terms of air purity, as a shield it was not. And there was less undergrowth camouflaging the walkers.
The pursuers did not give away their presence for some time, but when they realised that they were lagging behind, they also quickened their pace. After twenty minutes of brisk marching Andrew heard not only footsteps behind him, but also noisy breathing and even low voices from somewhere on the left flank. The men behind the group were clearly trying to take the walkers in their pincers.
The mechanic glanced round and noticed the intensely swiveling head of Andrew, slowed down and waited for the commander.
- They won't get through on the left," Max said quietly. - Kamenka has been blacklisted for a month. Anyway, some beasties made their camps there. Four stalkers perished there last week alone.
- And on the right?
- It's kind of clear up there. But these guys won't go around. They'll try to push through, attack right in the clearing.
- What makes you think so?
- Bandits. - Mechanic shrugged his shoulders. - Hear how they talk? All through the woods. Professionals don't do that. And if they are bandits, they will do it with a bang, as usual. In short, lead the people, I'll set the mines. As if I felt it, I brought three of them with me. They're directional, with radio detonators. It won't be easy for the gangsters.
- Stand down. - Andrey pushed the mechanic forward. - You will not have time. And we might need your mines too. Let's try to get away.
- Your madam is out of breath, she'll start stumbling soon.
- When she does, we'll decide. - The old man paid no attention to the underlying irony in Kruger's voice.
They quickly caught up with the group and with a few soft but insistent pokes in the back of their comrades to push the pace to the limit. Tatiana, contrary to Krueger's predictions, managed to equalize her breathing and the acceleration was sustained. Scout was the first to fall behind, not any of the women.
- My lung is shot! - He winced, breathing heavily, and then took a short, sharp step.
- You want your head blown off, too? - Olga hissed, snatching at his belt. - Run!
- You get off me! - Scout shook off her hand. - Run, I'll cover, I'm used to it!
- Forward! - ordered Andrew. - Scout, don't lag behind. You'll cover when there's a fierce necessity.
- And it already is. - Stalker suddenly raised his submachine gun and fired a short shot, aiming somewhere to the right, into the gap between the pines. - They've gone around!
- There's no one there! - Trying to put down the barrel of his gun Olga shouted. - You are de-masking us! On purpose, or what?!
- What are you, no eyes?! - Scout pushed the girl away and raised his machine gun to his shoulder again. - There they are!
They came from places other than the pathfinder's, and they came from a clearing in the forest. They came from the clearing. Andrey and the Mechanic immediately pushed their comrades under cover of pines to the left of the clearing and opened sparing fire with their relatively silent "shafts".
Olga, meanwhile, tore the leather pouch containing her Joker from around her neck and slipped the item into Scout's pocket.
The Stalker stared at Olga in surprise, then shook his head as if to shake off an illusion, and turned to face the clearing too.
- He was flattened again, damn it! What on earth was going on?
- The inspector was not alone. - Andrei nodded at Olga. - Now cover her with whatever you want. Without "Joker" she is a target number one for shooters.
- Let him have it!
- No. You have no resistance to psi-attack at all, without a second Joker, the controllers will take you like a puppy with their bare hands and wash your brains out. You'll think we're mutants.
- And what do we need? - Olga added.
- Well, follow me, - reluctantly offered her the stalker. - I am, as always, on edge.
The shooting from the clearing stopped, but the sound of footsteps intensified. The pursuers rushed through the young trees like moose in a rut, oblivious to the heavy bullets buzzing around.
- We must retreat," said the Mechanic. - In three hundred meters it's going to be a real b... is... well, the clearing, there is an anomaly on an anomaly. But we can pass normally with the Jokers, at a pace, and the bandits will definitely slow down.
- That's why they are in a hurry, - concluded Andrew. - They know about the glade too.
- It is not a secret. - The mechanic gave a short burst at a particularly loud crackling thicket. - Go on, I'll hold them off after all!
He took a couple of grenades out of his pouch and ripped off the rings.
Two explosions rang out as the group had already jumped to the edge and slowed down, trying to determine where there and what anomalies. Tatiana, as always, first thing grabbed the instruments, took out a detector, and Scout, wiping off sweat, went into his pocket for the nuts. Andrei and Olga just glanced around the clearing and almost simultaneously pointed to a barely visible path along the right-hand edge.
- Past the Funnel," Andrei said. - There's another 'Tramp' further on, but it's possible to squeeze through.
- A step to the left and we're screwed," Olga hesitated.
- "Take the Joker away for a while.
- No." She grimaced. - Artifacts make me sick, you know that. Hold on to my belt, if you have to.
- I'll hold it for you," Scout said. - Don't worry, no nonsense.
- Hey, stop!" a lopsided Mechanic burst out of the bushes. - You can't go in there. There's three pits in a row over there you can't see, 'Mouse traps. Follow me!
He stepped confidently forward and walked across the clearing... in a straight line. Tatiana rounded her eyes and looked at Andrew.
- There ... anomalies... all around! A natural minefield!
- Mechanic! - Shouted Andrew to the guide.
- Go ahead! - Kruger muttered irritably. - The bandits are gaining on us, there is no time to fidget!
- Never two wives, never one. - Scout sighed and grasped Olga firmly by the waist. - Shall we go, my dear, to the wedding?
- You promised not to be silly, Olga reminded him.
- Let's go, - at last Andrey made up his mind. - Tanya, follow them. If anything, just sit down and don't move.
A few shots rattled dryly through the woods, and leaden woodpeckers rattled in the nearby pines. A few bullets rattled to the left of the walkers. The old man suspected that if they hadn't had Jokers in their possession, the bullets would have flown a few yards to the right and the walkers would have suffered their first casualties, but all came to nothing and Andrew put the worry out of his mind. Right now it was the Mechanic that he had to worry about. More precisely, about the infallibility of his choice. Characteristic signs of the presence of anomalies could already be seen with the naked eye.
In the pre-dawn twilight it wasn't easy to see the dark spot and the light vortex over the Crow, which was closest to the edge. As for the Electra, which had occupied a legitimate ten meter diameter patch of ground just to the left of the trail, or the Skirp, to the right of the trail the Mechanic had traced, they could be tracked without the aid of detectors. There was a faint sparkling above the Elektra as the wind blew stale blades of grass and leaves into the anomaly. And "Trumpet" was kindly indicated by Scout. He tossed a nut into the anomaly, which accelerated and whistled forward, thumping against the trunk of a pine tree on the opposite edge.
The Funnel, however, was all right, too. Walkers walked literally three meters from the danger zone, even felt the pull - Tatiana slipped in the mud, and Andrew had to support her - but this time Jokers flawlessly performed the role of universal protection.
- There's something else there," Tatyana said nervously, clutching the detector in her hands. - Ahead. The mechanic goes right into the anomaly!
- Take it easy. - Andrei gripped her elbow tighter. - There's nothing up ahead, it's a suggestion. The bandits are accompanied by some controller, he's trying to throw us off.
- The one who made Scout shoot the empty light?
- That's the one. - Andrei looked around. - Quickly!
A hundred metres behind, at the edge of the forest, dark figures flashed. The old man estimated the number of pursuers. There were at least two dozen of them, and with them was someone strange. One of the figures was clad in a hooded cloak of some sort. The stranger wasn't aiming for the backs of the walkers like the others, but he was far more menacing. He touched his Joker pouch unconsciously, then slipped a hand into his pocket and fumbled with another artifact he'd never parted with: the Amulet he'd bought on a chain over a year ago from one of the secret labs. Compared to the Joker, the artificial artifact was a mere trifle, it only protected against psi interference, but that was exactly what was needed now. The old man was certain that it was only thanks to the two artefacts working together that he was able to withstand the onslaught of the controller on the clear island and felt nothing but a frightening psi wave now.
Tatiana turned around too and shuddered.
- They're... aiming right at us!
- Take it easy," Andrei repeated. - They're not going to shoot. The Ravenclaw's got us covered. Bullets won't get through.
- I think they're going to go around the clearing.
- That's what we need. Buys us some time.
- Five behind us!
- Step lively," said Old. - We'll make it.
Lunev was right. There was no trap straight ahead. The mechanic, followed by Scout and Olga seamlessly entered the forest on the other side of the clearing and slowed down, waiting for a lagging couple.
Andrei and Tatiana had only about twenty meters to go when the trio of comrades suddenly raised their weapons and opened fire. Bullets whistled very close and Tatyana was literally paralyzed by this music.
- Get down and to the left! - Scout shouted. - To the left go away!
At this he waved to the right. But Old understood him correctly. He grabbed Tatiana in an arm and jumped away from the line of fire where the stalker indicated. That is, to the right. Once under the cover of trees, Andrew gently leaned frightened friend to the pine, and himself joined the gunners.
The mechanic who had ordered them to open fire proved to be right. The five bandits on the group's heels were indeed dangerous. The moment the pursuers passed the "Funnel" there was nothing to prevent them from shooting Andrei and his companion in the back, and the bandits almost started shooting from the hip. Only counter fire was able to prevent them.
The five reflexively broke into a chain and tried to lay low, but only three succeeded. The outermost fighter on the left flank rolled back too far and hit the Electra. The anomaly immediately erupted in a burst of tiny white-blue lightning that illuminated the clearing no worse than a powerful mercury lamp. The man arched and convulsed. Gradually his face and hands turned black, and a bluish smoke billowed from his clothes. The nearest to the unfortunate bandit jerked to the rescue, but at the same second the Mechanic's gunshot rang out, and the hapless rescuer sank to the ground with a hole in his forehead.
The two bandits, huddled in the mud in the middle of the trail, began to slowly crawl away, but the right flanker was not frightened by the oncoming fire. The fighter rolled over, took an indirect shot, rolled over again, jumped to his feet and rushed forward. Taking a few steps, he dropped to the ground to get to a new position, but did not reach the ground. Exactly in his path was the shock anomaly "Trumpet". The bandit hovered a metre off the ground for a moment, then, receiving a powerful blow from an invisible fist, rushed forward as if on a hovercraft. On the third day of the weekly cycle of abnormal activity, the Trampons are in principle not as dangerous as they are just before the Ejection. They could only hit a man with lethal force within a short distance, but in this case it was just as far away as a palisade of trees.
The fighter crashed into a pine tree just to the right of Tatiana, and the distinct crunch of bones reached the ears of the walkers. Just in case, Andrey took a step to the side and took aim at the bandit, but almost immediately returned to his previous position. A living man could not lie in such a posture. The fighter's head was twisted at an unrealistic angle to the body.
The two surviving bandits stopped backing away and pressed themselves to the ground. The mechanic shot a few bullets in front of their noses, just in case, and backed into the woods. Behind him Scout backed up, and behind him Andrew dragged Tatiana away. The one who trailed off this time was Olga. She lingered at the edge of the clearing, trying to see someone at the other edge of the clearing.
- See someone you know? - asked Andrew as the group reunited and headed again to Opachica.
- Same as on the tree," said Olga. - And it's definitely not an ordinary controller.
- It is possible to kill it, and that is the main thing, - said Andrew. - Mechanic, will there be more anomalies?
- At the edge of the settlement. There will be a big "Carousel" just before the trail, but we'll notice it at once. Well, it's already the fourth cycle there. There's so much guts around, a blind man can see it. If he can't see it, he can hear it. There's crows circling around like a cemetery.
- Are there animals?
- I can't speak for them. They're not anomalies, they roam where their gut tells them to. I've only seen a couple of wild boars. But there's probably some dwarfs in the village, too. And bloodsuckers, what else could there be?
- Nightmare! - Silently horrified Tatiana.
- Do not worry, sister. - The mechanic grinned. - Not in the village, but on the edge, in the open space, we can defeat any creature.
- Thanks, brother, he calmed us down. - Tatiana from the fraternal treatment instantly concentrated and became almost the same. At least, she hid her fear deeper and cheered up.
Andrew smiled faintly. That was where it all began. In the first hours of acquaintance - two months ago - he also perceived Tatiana as a metropolitan girl obsessed with science. But less than a day later, he radically changed his attitude toward her. And after a month and completely ... But it started with the fact that Andrew was surprised by the nature of Tatiana Sergeyevna. She could be scared, at first even panicked, but after two or three shocks as if hardened and then acted almost on par with the experienced walkers. With the same equanimity, and without falling apart even in the most difficult situation.
- Stop talking," Olga suddenly hissed. - I sense the Controller. He's getting close.
The group lengthened their pace, but that did not prevent them from continuing their conversation. Only the sentences were shorter, so much so that they fit into a single exhalation. Scout, understandably the most restless, had invented this way of talking.
- So, Olya, you're not completely ignoring hypnosis... you're not completely ignoring it?
- I'm not. Shut up.
- But can you feel the controllers? How?
- My gut. Shut up, I said!
- What if there's a lot of them?
- It doesn't matter. Shut up!
- What if...
Scout didn't finish again, for suddenly he tripped, flopped on his stomach, and went about three metres in a skid. Olga slowed down and leaned over to help him up, but got a strong kick in the back and stretched beside the stalker.
The quickest to figure out what was wrong was Old. He pushed Tatiana aside and pressed her back against the nearest pine tree. He himself raised his assault rifle and fired several times into the air. Hearing the shots, Olga did not get up, but rolled onto her back and also began shooting at creatures diving from the gray sky. It was a dozen relatively small flying mutants that caused Scout, followed by Olga, to hit the ground. The mechanic cast a brief glance at the brightening sky and shook his head grudgingly.
- They know where we are going. - Kruger looked at Olga suspiciously. - 'I didn't warn you.
- Neither did I," the girl said, fending off the mutant attack. - And don't give me that look. Scout, you all right?
- Bit my tongue," the stalker said, rising and complaining.
- Oh, that's very good.
- That's very funny. - Scout spat. - You ought to be!
- Now we'll have to watch the air," Max concluded. - They've got us all covered.
- 'Do you think they will be waiting for us by the trail? - Lunev asked the mechanic.
- The main thing is not to fire mortars, and we`ll cope with an ambush. - Kruger grinned. - Who promised it would be easy?</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a3_doc_8">
    <text>When the walkers disappeared in the darkness Colonel Bibik strolled to the ring of glowing fog, folded his arms across his chest and stared thoughtfully at the strange phenomenon. Bibik had indeed seen something similar twice or three times in the Zone and the Borderlands, but, frankly, it had never occurred to him to study the phenomenon. And apparently he wasn't the only one. Bibik never heard of military guides or free stalkers talking about rings of greenish fog. In fact, that's why the colonel told Old that this short-term anomaly is not dangerous. Any problems with it even once, word would spread around the base in an instant. But nothing of the sort had happened, so there was no cause.
Bibik stood honestly by the rippling ring for five minutes, fumbled in his pocket, fumbled for a coin, tossed it into the circle, listened to the copper ringing as it bounced across the plaza pavement, and moved with a clear conscience to his squad's location. The old man was of course an experienced walker, and his instinct for danger was that of a godsend, but in this case the retired mercenary was clearly overreacting.
"Morning, fog, what's so strange? - Bibic yawned and shivered. - It's not hot, but it's not freezing either. Plus it's damp like this. What else should it be, frost or something?"
Suddenly something distinctly crunched behind him, and the colonel, stumbling on a level place, froze. Actually it crunched as if instead of fog there really was frost on the parade ground and someone big and heavy was slowly walking on it. Bibik put his hand on the holster with an old-fashioned, but much-loved Stechkin system pistol and turned around.
A dark figure towered in the centre of the circle. Whether it was human or mutant, it was impossible to see. The figure wavered like a tongue of black flame. Bibik hurriedly took out of his pocket a lightweight "NATO" version of a goggle and put it on his nose. The image intensified by the device was not much different from the visible without electronic processing. In the greenish ring of mist, slowly drifting to the left, waved a human-like figure. As the dark figure slowly moved to the side, clearing the centre of the circle, a second one emerged. A second figure emerged. Didn't emerge from some dungeon or parachute down. Just appeared. Out of nowhere. Seconds later, the second figure also shifted to the periphery of the circle, and a third took up the centre.
By now Bibik had overcome his stupor and was beginning to understand exactly what was happening. He frantically found his communicator and pressed the emergency button.
The base officer on duty answered instantly.
- Red alert," he said in a low voice. - Code red. Code red. "Base is under attack.
- Say again," the duty officer asked dryly.
The creatures inside the fog ring moved sharply in Bibik's direction and in just a second found themselves halfway between their point of origin and the colonel's position. Bibik abruptly drew his pistol from its holster, assumed a standing shooting position and opened a cursory fire.
Apparently, this "repetition" satisfied the duty officer. A long, slow-growing howl of alarm bellowed through the base.
Bullets paused the trio of creatures, but none of them dropped dead. The black shadows simply froze in place, letting Bibik waste all twenty rounds of ammunition, and then slowly moved on. The creatures' behaviour was odd, but Beebick could make sense of their movements without difficulty. Their first jerk was a sort of declaration: "This is how we do it. Then they clearly showed that they could not be taken with the personal firearms, and finally they politely asked to move away.
The colonel backed away at about the same pace as the creatures approached, trying at the same time to reload the Stechkin and reconnect with the officer on duty. The pistol was quick and clear, but the connection was unwelcome. There were no beeps or interruptions, only silence.
For a short while Bibik decided that everything was an illusion. The creatures moved too smoothly, unnaturally smoothly. And the siren roared in a voice that was not his own, and besides it, there was no other sign of an alarm at the base. There was no one running, no one lining up, no one unpacking equipment, no one rushing to the place where several bursts of automatic pistol fire had just been heard.
But it seemed so to Bibik only for a moment. In fact, that was why the siren blared and no one rushed to help until now. Time stretched like a rubber band for the colonel, and a second became almost an eternity. However, it really only seemed that way to Bibik. False eternity abruptly ended, time regained its normal pace, and the colonel forgot about illusions. The attack on the base was real.
More creatures were emerging from the glowing circle, and now they were not only shapeless black shadows, but the familiar, only unusually large mutants of the bloodsucker, snark and pseudo-giant type. Seeing these mutants in the same formation was strange, but Bibik had no trouble recalling several situations where mutants had teamed up in even stranger brigades.
And through all these episodes, a red thread ran through the main thing - the association of mutants foreshadowed serious trouble for humans.
"And then there's these... in robes. They're supposed to be hypnotists as well as controllers. They've got me all worked up, and time's gone up in smoke. We got a problem, though. The old one was right, as usual. What a man's instincts... ...is an animal instinct. He'd give any mutant a hundred points ahead of him."
The thought of Andrew's special intuition stirred some vague doubts in his soul, but a second later Bibik was no longer concerned with them. The creatures crawling out of the fog circle were spreading rapidly across the base. Though the larger mutants were easy to track, the second wave, consisting chiefly of vipers and rats, was far from halted or tracked. The little monsters scattered like peas through the nearest nooks and crannies, scouring the smallest nooks and crannies for access to basements and utility rooms of buildings.
Such rapid developments did not please Bibik at all. The stomping of many feet could be heard behind him. Colonel looked around and waved a hand, hurrying the approaching fighters.
- Pashkov, to me!
The commander of one of the combat groups of Special Forces ran up to the colonel and covered him from the approaching crowd of mutants.
- Stand down, Colonel!
- Stand down! Go with your group to the armory, which is next to the fuel depot, there are flamethrowers there. Bring them here! And bring gasoline, oil, anything that burns!
- Yes, sir!
The soldier rushed away and Bibik having hidden behind parked nearby "UAZ" gave the signal to other soldiers.
- Take positions! Machine gunners, on points! The others with grenades - fire!
Something solidly rumbled on a cowl of the car. Sideways sighted Bibik saw a fighter with a heavy machine gun. A second later the second soldier appeared next to the first, with two cartridges in his hands. It took the machine gunner no more than three seconds to load, but in that time the mutants had managed to come almost close.
- What ammo?! - shouted Bibik, turning to the second fighter.
- Ordinary and tracers!
- Leave it and go get the BZ!
- Aye!
Soldier left the boxes and rushed towards the ammunition depot, but managed to make only a dozen steps. From the centre of the circle of mist, a swarm of large, man-sized creatures suddenly erupted. They soared to a height of about fifty meters, circled above the square, and swooped down on the men's position. The first casualty of the flying mutants was the same fighter that Bibik had sent for armor-piercing incendiary ammunition. The damned "batmen" lifted the guy high into the air and set off something like a short set of air volleyball. Only instead of a ball they had a man, and after each pass there was less and less living mass left of the fighter. Body parts and shreds of uniforms flew in all directions, and very soon there was virtually nothing left of the guy. The severed head fell not far from the UAZ and bounced and rolled under the car.
- Well, bitches! - The machine gunner beside Bibik gritted his teeth and began shooting long tracer bursts at the encroaching mutants.
- Air! - Bibik belatedly shouted and started shooting at the flying creatures with his Stechkin.
Another machine gun went off to the left of the colonel's position, then machine guns and grenade launchers rattled from the first floor of the nearest barracks. Most of the grenades fell precisely into the circle, ripping several dozen mutants to shreds, but that did not solve the problem. The monsters were climbing out of the greenish ring, totally oblivious to the fire of the defenders.
- How many of them are there?! - Hurriedly changing the machine gun ribbon, muttered the fighter next to Bibic. - I didn't take a reserve gun...
- You shouldn't have," said Bibik, reloading his gun.
The stomping and humming of motors was heard behind again. The colonel turned around in the hope of seeing the flamethrowers rushing to help, but saw only a platoon of soldiers running at full speed and three Humvees with large-caliber machine guns on the roofs. The machine gunners in the Humvees were awake and trying to take anti-aircraft fire from the move. In principle, they were doing everything right. No special accuracy was required in this situation. What was required was a lot of accuracy. The flying things, like a black cloud, obscured the sky.
Large-caliber bullets did the job easily, "batmen" fell to the ground in packs, but simultaneously new swarms rose from the ominous circle, and there was no number of them. A few dozen particularly nimble flying mutants managed to break through the dense fire and attacked the machine that was coming in on the left flank. Their ugly bodies, wrapped in some kind of rags, for a second completely covered "Hummer" and when visibility was restored, Bibic saw that the machine gunner was only the hand of his right hand, firmly gripped in the trigger.
- Battalions here! - Unclear to whom shouted Bibik. - Where are the fucking flamethrowers!
The machine gun nearby fell silent, and the colonel looked around anxiously. The machine gunner was fine, just charging the last strip.
- Pull back," he muttered, not looking at the commander. - The last box. And it'll overheat soon enough.
The ground monsters took advantage of the pause and dashed forward. The machine gun jerked again, slowing the advancing mass, but a few of the bloodsuckers managed to jump to Bibik's position. The colonel heartily kicked one monster in the stomach, causing the bloodsucker to fly back about three meters, where he was instantly cut in half by a machine gun round. Bibik stopped the second one with a rather deft chopper, and when it fell on its back, the colonel stuck his hand with a pistol into the monster's mouth without any fear or squeamishness. The tentacles around the bloodsucker's mouth immediately came into motion and wrapped around the Colonel's arm, but a short burst blew the bloodsucker's ugly head apart - and the tentacles went limp.
Dozens of grenades were again fired into the fog ring, but this time, judging by the density of fire and the patterns of explosions visible to the professional eye, it was not an "arming device. From somewhere to the south, from behind the hangars, the "Flame" grenade launchers opened fire. Bibik nodded approvingly. The creatures still managed to get out of the circle, but at least now at least not in a continuous flow. For a while, the colonel even got hope that this "breakthrough of the flue pipe" could be eliminated. However, as soon as the grenade launchers could be silenced for a short while, a new flock of batmen burst out of the ring and took off running towards the positions of the grenade launchers.
There was indiscriminate firing from behind the hangars, a few explosions, then another round of less heavy fire, and then the final, particularly powerful explosion. A cloud of black smoke enveloped the nearby hangar, from which a dozen or so monsters sprang a few seconds later. A few shots rang out after them, but there was no more heavy fire.
The machine gun nearby went silent. The fighter looked questioningly at the colonel.
- Yes, let's retreat, - Bibik decided. - We'll lock up at the depots. There are the cartridges nearby, antiaircraft guns with flamethrowers, and communication. And the main thing is the BMP.
The Colonel gestured for retreat and the survivors of the blockade rose from their positions. It turned out that the losses, despite the best efforts of the machine gunners, were quite significant. There were no human bodies on the abandoned positions, but only because the monsters were tearing people to shreds. In fact, half as many soldiers were leaving this line of defence as had arrived to rescue Bibik.
The colonel ran up to the nearest Humvee and jumped on the step and assessed the situation from a relative elevation.
The dense fire of the retreating fighters held back the onslaught of monsters in a "step back - two forward" pattern. Slowly but surely the infernal army advanced toward the centre of the base. As for its northern part, closer to where the breakthrough ring had formed, it was irretrievably lost to humans. Up to the northern wall of the outer perimeter, the area was covered in a swarming grey mass of mutants. Bibik jumped off the footplate and quickly, no longer trying to shoot back, staggered towards the brick buildings of the armoury.
Engineers had considered the possibility of breaching the base's outer perimeter when designing the warehouse complex, and so the warehouses had been built in the shape of an octagon. Eight two-storey brick buildings with one metre thick walls, no windows on the ground floor and narrow window embrasures on the first floor, eight gates in the gaps between the ends of the buildings and sixteen towers on each side of the gate turned the complex into a veritable citadel. In addition, all the buildings were connected by underground passageways, allowing ammunition and manpower to be evenly distributed throughout the defence perimeter.
And that it would have to be so, Bibik had no doubt. The northern part of the base was lost, the scattered remnants of the commandant company and several groups of military guides were retreating from the east under the onslaught of mutants. In the west desperately fought the battalion of "cleaners", but there was no expectation of a breakthrough. Moreover, the backs of the soldiers were already flickering between the barracks and other buildings in the western sector. It had been relatively quiet to the south of the warehouse citadel, in the commercial and scientific sector, but sporadic gunfire could be heard there as well, which meant that small groups of mutants had infiltrated there as well.
Beebick ran. He had to get to the new positions before the fighters retreated there, so he could get everyone in numbers at once.
From the nearest gate, the major, the head of the warehouse complex, ran towards the colonel. He was in a belligerent mood, though profuse sweat appeared on his face clearly not from prolonged running, but from fear.
- That's lucky! - Bibik waved to the major. - Get back! Prepare to defend! Machine gunners to the towers!
The major nodded and backed away.
- Stop!" shouted Bibik. - Have you seen Pashkov?
- There. - The major pointed to the nearest warehouse. - Flamethrowers... he's trying to start them up.
- What are they, gramophones for winding up?!
- Well, I mean... to load 'em up. Flamethrower's not enough," the major sulked. - Almost none. We didn't think...
Bibic was furious.
- You sold it, didn't you?! You backstabbing rat! When this mess is over, I'll skin you myself! Get back to your place!
Bibik followed the major through the ajar gate and almost ran into the soldier, loaded with two machine guns. The colonel grabbed one and pointed to the tower to the right of the gate. The Colonel grabbed one of them and pointed to the fighter on the right of the gate.
As soon as the colonel set the machine gun in the socket, the communicator showed signs of life. The hearing was a mess, but Bibic easily recognized the caller.
- Bibic, where are you?
- Locking on to the warehouse complex, General!
- Send men to the south and southwest gates to cover. I'm leading a large group of civilians.
- You got it! - Bibik spotted the approaching group of failed flamethrowers and hunkered down. - Pashkov! One fighter over here!
- They pushed all the flamethrowers in the market! - Shouted Pashkov from below. - Smoker, probably leaked, or someone else!
- I know! Go to the south gate, meet the civilians!
- Yes, sir!
- On the phone, General, - said Bibik again in a headset. - Any other orders?
- Get the vehicles inside the citadel, secure the gates.
- We're already rolling, it's a standard plan, we worked it out in the training.
- That's all for now, then. No, that's not all. Do me a favor, wait for me alive.
- I'll do my best!
- Answer by the book!
- Wait for you alive!
- That's another matter. Over and out.
Bibik gave way to the machine gunner who had climbed the tower and climbed down the fire pole.
- Do you dance at your leisure? - Major Brazhnikov, commander of the special forces reconnaissance detachment, suddenly appeared next door. - What bar?
- Joke at my place. - Bibik pulled the major by the sleeve, pulling him out of the way of the BMP entering the citadel. - What are you doing here? I thought Ostapenko sent you on a special mission.
- At seven zero zero. - Brazhnikov put up his hand with a watch. - And now it's twenty to nothing.
- Forty minutes already? - Bibik shook his head in surprise. - As if it had been one instant. How do you think to act now?
- According to the situation. - The major shrugged his shoulders. - If the general confirms the order, I'll sneak in somehow, it's not the first time. But if not... there's a job for me too.
Brazhnikov suddenly took up his assault rifle and shot into the air. The downed Batman fell from the dark sky. The monster was still alive and even dangerous, but did not have time to do anything. Some soldier ran up to the mutant from behind with a sapper in his hand. One swing - and the creature lost his head. Brazhnikov gave the fighter a thumbs up.
- That's right Dan, the ammunition will be useful, and the blade, if it gets blunt, can always be sharpened!
- Do you think the dance will last long? - Not looking at the major Bibik asked.
- I think, yes. But I've got another question: where do they crawl out of? Have they dug an underground passage?
- No, I saw the place, it was something else. And there's so many of them coming in, it's like they're being stamped. It's like they're being stamped in there. Countless.
- Some kind of mysticism. - Brazhnikov grinned.
- You bet!" - Bibik pointed to the south gate through which the first refugees started to enter the citadel. - Go and meet them, talk to Ostapenko. Otherwise you won't be able to get out of here later. Animals will surround you, you will have nowhere to spit.
- Goodbye. - The major clapped Bibik on the shoulder and rushed towards them.
The colonel waved after the scout and walked to the northern gate. The last fighters were just entering it. Bibik glanced over the square in front of the gate, swarmed on the other side of the square grey mass of the attacking enemy, made a few steps to the side and gave the signal to the BMP commander. The heavy vehicle roared its engine, backed up and stopped, with its stern against the gate. Almost simultaneously, five more gates were locked in the same way.
The southern gate remained open for the longest time. But when all the refugees and the accompanying military entered through it, it closed as well.
The military base of the International Isolation Force Dyatky 3 was itself in total isolation....</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a3_doc_9">
    <text>All the way to the outskirts of Opacichi, the pursuers did not bother the group in any way, apart from some mild but persistent pressure on the psyche. According to Olga, at least one other monster of the same species had joined the leader of the bandit group, but they were not about to attack yet. Apparently, they were waiting for reinforcements. When Lunev asked from which direction this reinforcement was to come, Olga confidently pointed to the northeast. That is, straight ahead.
- There is an ambush, and in it two more controllers.
- How do you know all that? - Scout wondered. - Your gut tells you something, I know it does, a convincing explanation. I know it in my head when they're being treaded on, I can see it in my head. But how do you know how many there are, and where they're hiding?
- It sounds like a sound, like a loud whisper. - Olga shrugged her shoulders. - Why are you bothering me? I don't know how to explain it in a simpler way!
- I didn't ask for simpler. - Scout pointed a finger at her. - You must admit that you're a little... huh?
- A little what? - Olga visibly tensed and put her finger on the safety of her gun. - What are you hinting at?
- A mind reader, are you? - Scout became bolder. - And if you're not a secret Cossack, Olya?
- Stop! - interfered Andrew. - You, stalker, now you agree! If you dig, we can write us all mutants.
- And some even in moral freaks! - Snorted Olga and sparkled angrily.
- Why are you defending her? - Scout squinted suspiciously. - What, the general has entrusted you with some secret, has he? You are the main characters, and the rest of the crowd?
- You got carried away again? - Quietly asked Andrew. - Shall I hang a third artifact around your neck?
- No, I'm not right, am I?
- You're wrong," the mechanic said softly, flicking the safety catch above Scout's ear. - And shut up, you're de-masking us again, we're getting close.
- Oh, I see, all heroes, I'm the only one who's a burden! - Scout slung his automatic on his shoulder. - I can wait here, while you cut the ambush into cabbages. I'm no good to you anyway!
- You are wrong again, - Tatiana interfered now. - You are counting on sympathy, but no one will convince you.
- And do not!
In the thicket, just behind Scout loudly rattled deadwood, and stalker suddenly changed his mind to stay in the back. He threw off his gun from his shoulder, turned around, and, warily looking at the bushes, began to move back behind the group.
- Hey, hold up! - Scout threw over his shoulder. - Can't you hear it? Or maybe you're hallucinating again?
- There's flesh in there," said Andrew. - Let it live. Catch up.
- Yes, it stinks like flesh," Scout grimaced. - 'All right, I'll go with you. But if you hit me again, I'll go back to the clean island and go to sleep!
- Eternal slumber," Olga muttered. - Old one, slow down. There's no bandits up ahead. The controllers have brought someone more serious. I can feel the mutants tense, they're barely in control of their charges.
- "It's Duty," the Mechanic backed up Olga, nestling into the eyepiece of the scope. - 'Look, over there on the hill... That's it, they're hidden. "Duty men, that's right. We'll have to improvise.
- On the left is open ground, on the right is an old brook bed, it is more convenient to follow it, - suggested Olga.
- They are waiting for us there, - Andrey protested. - Let's go along the edge of the forest. At least our left flank will be safe.
- No room to maneuver,' objected the Mechanic.
- Out of the question. Come on!
- As you wish. - Kruger grinned. - Wherever we go, they'll know we're coming. I'll bet you a hundred.
Andrew gestured for them to stop and pointed east. The group continued at the same pace through the shimmering forest and managed to cover the kilometre without any trouble. When the road went uphill - the walkers had reached the hill where Mekhanik had spotted a patrol of Dungovs - Andrew looked back and saw several pursuers' figures. No matter how hard the fugitives tried to break away, the bandits followed on their heels and stubbornly did not want to lag behind.
Olga appeared next to Lunev. She held the commander by the sleeve and whispered as they slightly lagged behind the group:
- There's a plan!
Old nodded.
- Outline.
- If we let the bandits drive us into Duty, we'll end up in a ring. But if the ambush or the corridors don't have the support of the controllers, they'll start shooting not at us, you know? For example, if the 'debtors' wake up and see an armed gang rushing at them... what will they do?
- Grind the Archangels into cabbage, - grasped the thought Andrew. - And strangers won't help the bandits. They simply will not have time. We only have to get out of the line of fire in time.
- Exactly.
- But it is easier to eliminate the aliens in the pursuit group.
- I agree.
- What if the telepaths read our plan?
- And we won't let anyone. - Olga glanced expressively ahead. - I'll tell you a secret: mutants can't read minds. To subdue their will, to iron out their brains, even to scorch them to hell - easily, but to catch without the consent of the person, what he thinks, they are weak. They can only know our plans if someone whispers to them. Voluntarily.
- You mean if there's a telepath in our midst and he's the enemy? Do you know what you're talking about?
- Same thing. But unlike some overzealous stalkers, I'm not declaring anyone a mutant. And there are telepaths among humans. Even on Greater Earth.
- It can't be one of us. - Andrei shook his head. - Everyone has been checked a hundred times over. Everyone is a hundred percent normal.
- I'm not a hundred percent," Olga reminded him quietly. - 'But I'm not a telepath. Neither, I'm sure, are you. So... if the others are unaware of the plot, there's no risk.
- Got the suspicion virus from Scout? - The old man shook his head disapprovingly.
- 'Strictly speaking, the Mechanic was the first to be suspicious,' Olga replied grudgingly. - 'I'm just taking precautions.
- 'The General promised a sixth,' recalled Andrei, 'who may go on a parallel course. True, he's probably checked and rechecked personally by the General too... But ... someone is selling us out, it can be considered a proven fact, you and Mechanic are right.
- All the more reason not to discuss the plan in public. - Olga's face showed that she was skeptical about Old's version of the sixth, but understood how much he did not want to suspect his subordinates of treachery, and sympathized with the commander. - When we get close to the ambush, I'll fall back, retreat into the woods and wait for the bandits. When they pass by, I'll blow the brains out of the mutants leading the gang and get away. In the meantime, you guys shoot at all the lights and go off to the right. I'll meet you there.
- That's a smart plan, just two questions: are you sure the mutants won't kill you first? And two... it's going to take some very delicate timing to make it work, how are you going to do that?
- Controllers can't sense me, I know that. And the timing... If there's a fight, I'll shoot on the sly.
- So we're going to be in the crosshairs either way?
- That's right. But this way we've got a chance, and if we get surrounded, we've got no chance.
- All right," said Old Man after a thought. - Just don't climb any trees. Snipers only sit like that in the movies. The more uncomfortable the position, the greater the chance of not being seen.
- Don't teach a lady to button her bra. - Olga grimaced, but not annoyed, but a little tired. She even had something like a smile on her lips. - I'll see you later.
- No problem. - Andrew nodded and went to catch up with the group.
Olga's plan was not bad, but still raw, and adjustments had to be made at the first second of aggravation of the situation. Ambush dolgovtsami was staged competently, and controlling their creatures did not give away their presence, so, despite the full combat readiness of walkers, mess began unexpectedly. The crossfire forced the group to scatter into the bushes and lay low. None of the foursome was able to return fire, crawl to the right, or even raise their heads. So when they heard the clatter of fleeing bandits behind them, Andrew had an unpleasant thought that his conversation with Olga was being overheard by someone. Whether it was the mysterious sixth, or whether the girl was wrong about mutant telepaths not being able to read people's minds, didn't matter now. The plan had clearly failed, and the walkers had no choice but to stand upright and engage in combat, relying on their own training and the protection of the Jokers.
Andrei had already begun to rise when the advancing wave of pursuers suddenly slowed down and opened fire from the move... at the Dowagers' positions. In the ensuing firefight, the chances of catching a stray bullet were just as good, but the situation had improved nonetheless. Fighters of the group "Duty" are also out of control outsiders - at least in part - and went about their usual business: the destruction of bandits, rather than shooting harmless, and besides having an official pass to the Zone, walkers.
"The idea is that if you destroy the controllers who sit in the second line of ambush, you can use the Dutya fighters as an escort. The group is paramilitary, prefers not to quarrel with the official authorities... But is it worth experimenting? The best ally for us is stealth."
Andrei crawled over to Tatiana, pointed her in the direction to move, and then found Scout and Mechanic with a glance. They didn't need any advice, they figured out what to do on their own.
Not ten minutes later the group found themselves far enough away from the scene of the fight, in a shallow gully, the bed of a long-dried stream on the eastern slope of a wooded hill.
- "Wrapping up our plot, letting us go already," Scout quoted, rising and shaking off his clothes somehow. - 'I don't get it. You said there were telepaths in the front and the back. Why'd they bump their wards against each other?
- You'd better ask them," the Mechanic murmured. - Old one, where's Olga? What, the first losses?
Andrew did not have time to answer.
- You will lose her, of course! - Snorted Scout. - Here she comes.
He pointed down the slope. Olga was walking briskly though the dry riverbed was heavily littered with needles, limbs and stones. Having seen that the brave girl was in good order, Andrew imperceptibly, as it seemed to him, exhaled with relief. Tatiana noticed this and raised an unfriendly glance at her friend in arms. Olga looked at the Old One in surprise, and then at everyone else in turn.
- What?
- Nothing," Andrei said. - We were worried about you. Did it all work out?
- We got out of it, didn't we? - Olga shrugged her shoulders. - The bandits never understood anything. As soon as the psi-control vanished, they thought they'd come here to fight the Duty, so they rushed in to attack. The controllers escorting the Dungovs smelled something fishy and took off. I saw it myself. I don't think they got far. They're afraid to come back without our scalps.
- Did they tell you that themselves? - Scout got wary again.
- Don't start that nonsense again, okay? - Olga brushed him off. - I was just making an assumption. Those advanced controllers are still around, I can smell them. And if they haven't gone away, it means they're out to get us after all.
- But do not attack themselves, because they are afraid, - said Olga Andrew. - After the incident on the clear island, it's no wonder. They don't return home, for fear of punishment from their mates or master. I don't know if they have someone in charge or if it's just the collective mind that runs everything.
- "Oh, I see," Kruger cut in. - 'The important thing is that the way is clear. We'll be nearly at our destination by the stream. Shall we go?
- Yes, go ahead, - agreed Lunev. - Tatyana, stay a bit longer.
Reluctantly she slowed down, but did not look at the Old One.
- What?
- You tell me, - Andrew took her by the hand, - what are you pouting?
- How long have you known her? - Tatiana still reluctantly asked. - Your ex?
- You're out of your mind. - Andrew grinned. - We know her... Less than twenty-four hours of pure time. We bumped into each other in the Zone in the fall, turned out that we both work for Ostapenko. That's how we met. And then we parted like two bullets in a duel. Haven't seen each other till today. You believe me?
- I do. Sorry.
- It's okay. It's kind of nice. You're jealous, so it's not that simple. Yes?
- Andrei, I don't know... - Tatiana lowered her gaze to the ground. - Don't rush things, please. And as for this girl... don't think I'm out of jealousy again... there's something wrong with her.
- It's not news. - Andrew nodded. - But there's no need to be wary of it. Don't listen to Scout, he's just a jerk. Olga is not like the others, but she is human and her soul will always be on the side of people.
- It's not about Scout, who he is, I knew right away. But I think he's right about something. You're saying that Olga will be on the side of people... but I'm not so sure about that.
- About what? That she has a soul? - The old one grinned again. - You're talking about the soul in the literal sense, not like me. Isn't that right? And these are the words of a scientist? Aren't you supposed to be an atheist?
- No, I'm not. I know I'm minding my own business, but... Believe me, science is first and foremost a close observation of nature, whether it's general or specific. First and foremost, scientists know how to observe and notice what others don't see or don't want to see. I cannot yet articulate exactly what I see, but it frightens me. That's why I'm talking to you.
- Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Of course, I don't believe in Olga's heartlessness, but I'll try to find out what's wrong with her. Although... the only thing that matters to our mission is that she is not susceptible to any kind of psi influence.
- There may be a connection between the cause of my concern and this talent of hers.
- We'll figure it out, I promise. - Andrei put his arm around Tatiana's shoulders. - Only later. Right now we need to concentrate on the short-range tasks at hand. Not as mysterious, but no less important.
- Get on the trail? - Tatiana shook her head. - So far we've been lucky.
- And to stay alive. So far we have been lucky, too, but our luck might run out.
- Creepy prognosis. - Tatiana shivered involuntarily.
- One should not rely entirely on luck, then the forecast will not come true.
The further way seemed to be a real compensation for all the troubles previously experienced. The forest had brightened up considerably: it was a gloomy winter morning and the trees had parted as they said. Though it started to drizzle irritatingly small but the walkers were not accustomed to that. It was pleasant to some extent. The measured sound of tiny drops falling on their hoods was a great way to calm their nerves. Besides it was a lucky walk downhill and no one was breathing down our necks.
After half an hour of calm, relatively leisurely march an almost peaceful expression appeared on faces of Scout, Tatiana and Olga. Andrey remained pensive, but also not as tense as during the stretch from the clear island to the ambush. The only one who didn't allow himself to relax was the Mechanic. He, as if he had heard his commander's wish "not to rely entirely on luck", walked with the utmost caution to the outskirts of the village drowned in the thicket. It was only when he saw the Carousel ahead that Max relaxed a little too. He slung the gun on his shoulder and nodded ahead.
- There's a path over there. You can't see it from here, so take your word for it, the road to Jampol starts in the bushes to the left of the barns. We'll take it. There is almost no asphalt on it, but it's still more pleasant to walk than on the gullies.
- There is only one left to go round "Carousel". - Lunev looked ahead through the optics. - It is big, the devil.
- That's when size counts," said the mechanic. - You can't go around on your left, through the woods. I mean, you can, but it's no use. You can't get to the trail. Going in from the north would be no different. Leaving the eastern access, but if the edge of the village to stampede, it can drag, and if you go further away - can mutants eat. It's like walking on a razor blade.
- We've got Jokers," Andrei reminded us.
- I've got that in mind. - Kruger nodded. - Not a good idea without them. I reckon there's a reason Carousel's been here a month. I don't know how long it's been here. It's like a gateway. Anyone with particularly large and strong artifacts gets through. The rest of us are left with nothing but mincemeat.
- Artifacts from Sector 13?
- That's the one.
- Let's hope ours are just as good.
The old man gestured for them to move on. The group descended towards the village and slowly moved tangentially towards the Carousel.
Locating the anomaly turned out to be really easy. The circle, within which all living things perished after being caught in a violent spin, was clearly drawn. Piles of rotting remains and scraps of equipment from a distance of a couple of hundred meters looked like a disgusting butcher's dump, covered in a stirring gray-black foam. A number of rats and crows fought over the brownish, greenish, mouldy human and animal carcasses. Both were incalculable. The noise in the small clearing was deafening. Even a tropical storm could not drown out the squeaks and cries of the birds, much less the whispering of rain and a gentle breeze. The situation was roughly as bad as the smells. The stench on the outskirts of Opacic was so bad that the group, without any command from Old, hurriedly threw on their filter masks, though there was little danger of inhaling a hot particle or of being poisoned by some marsh gas.
Slowly, avoiding the small but no less dangerous creatures, they crossed a third of the way and almost encountered a new problem. Several pseudo-pogs, mutants that look more like large wolves than dogs, waddled out of the bushes at the start of the path. The creatures froze for a moment on the path, then dropped to the ground before launching off sharply in the direction of the group. The sight of a dozen or so of the monsters lunging toward them, dirty and spitting, left the attackers slightly confused, but by the time the pseudo-dogs had come within leaping distance, all five of the group's guns were pointed squarely at the pack. The fleeing fire put half the monsters in the dirt and forced the remainder to retreat, but the shots scared off the crows and attracted the attention of the rats. The sky instantly turned black with outspread wings, and the ground turned uniformly gray and littered with wet rat pelts. A gray wave rolled from the edge of the anomaly toward the walkers, and the group had to turn to flee again.
The pace was not easy, but they had to run very fast behind each other. Even the almighty Joker could not cope with the force of the "Carousel", even if they deviated even a meter to the left, so powerful was the anomaly. Two high, slippery earth ramparts and a deep ditch between them made it impossible to swerve to the right. And if they had managed to take a right, no good would have come of such a manoeuvre, that was for sure. There were as many rats on the other side of the parallel banks as there were around the Carousel.
The coldest members of the group - Lunev and Mechanic - tried to shoot a few so-called rat wolves on the move, particularly large creatures that led many small packs that make up the gray horde together, but the shooters' efforts were in vain. Either the rats were being led by someone other than their usual leaders, or they didn't need a leader. In the dim light of their efforts, the mercenaries glanced at each other briefly, then dashed off to follow the group.
The rats caught up with the walkers the second the leader of the race, Scout, opened fire from the waist and burst into the cherished bushes. A long shot had no effect, no one was waiting for the group in the bushes, and the pseudo-dogs vanished as if they had not existed at all. As for the rats...
Dozens of large gray creatures, claws and teeth clawed at the legs of the group, then began to climb up their gear as they struggled to reach vulnerable or exposed areas.
The rats were no match for the Kevlar wetsuits and lightweight armor with ceramic-metal inserts, but they were still uncomfortable for a few seconds. The mechanic didn't have time to shake off all the rodents, and one of the creatures caught on the edge of his mask and scratched his cheekbone deeply. Kruger managed to shove the rat into the bushes as well, but it was too late. On his return to the base, Max was given a course of injections, like those given for rabies. However, the former mercenary was unlikely to be upset by this prospect. It was not a leg that had been pulled off. And injections, pills, hospital boredom after every other raid... that's standard in the Zone.
Everyone else was a little luckier, they got off with what is called a light fright. Once on the path, walkers instantly oriented, where to run, and rushed, beating the last of his strength.
The rats would probably have been able to reach speed and maintain their pace, but they lagged behind almost immediately. Strictly speaking, they had only got to the trail by inertia. After about a hundred meters there was not a single grey creature left behind them on the rugged, cracked road. Old was the first to be convinced of this.
At the risk of running out of breath, Andrew looked back and immediately shifted his pace. The trail seemed to be a sort of forbidden place for the local mutants, like a clear island. That's why the pseudo-dogs passed through it in transit (both ways) and the rats didn't stay on it. What was the trick here, Andrew didn't ponder.
"Little does it matter? There are so many intricacies and subtleties in the Zone, it can break your brain to think about them all. And brains can still come in handy..."
As soon as Lunev thought so, it turned out that there was at least one person in the group who did not care about his brain. It's not hard to guess who.
- We're behind, aren't we? - Scout stopped and leaned on his knees, trying to catch his breath. In that pose he waited for his commanding officer. - Isn't this a dining area? Hello, people, whoa!
- Stop ... commanding," murmured Andrew, breathing heavily.
- I'm just... clear... - Scout shook his head and pulled off his mask. - 'Alright, I'll say no more. Oh, it doesn't stink here either, though the wind from the rubbish dump looks like it's headed our way.
- It's a path," said the returning Mechanic meaningfully. - 'Think of it as the start of the Thirteenth Sector.
- What do you mean?
- The visible part of it," Tatiana said. - Remember, I explained?
- Ah, well... no, I sort of remember, but I don't understand. You said he occupies a whole sector, but it does not affect the other.
- It doesn't, stupid! - Olga was the last to arrive at the short resting place. - Go off the path and you will find yourself in a normal sector.
- Even if you take a step back, you won't be able to get back. Only again through the "Carousel" in Opacichi, - the Mechanic finished his thought. - Feuerstein?
- Ja, naturlich. - Scout nodded. - 'And how wide is this trail?
- Different. Here it is as wide as this road, in Yampolje it is half kilometre, and where Cherevach is in normal Zone, it will be one and a half. Then it narrows, but near Korogod it starts widening again, and the closer you get to the hidden part of the sector, the wider it gets. And after the entrance, which I told you about, there is... Everywhere you turn, in short, there's the Thirteenth. There's only one exit to the outside world, you know, the entrance. It's an exit.
- Which, by the way, is not quite clear, - Tatiana said. - From the scientific point of view. If we are already in the Thirteenth sector, the entrance, theoretically, left there in Opacichi. If the sector begins in the Chernobyl-2 area, then where are we now?
- For what I bought, for what I sell. - Krueger threw up his hands. - You're the science, you do the guessing.
- Look, Mechanic, wait a minute," Scout said. - You say where in the normal Zone Cherevach stands. And in the Thirteenth ... or where we are now... There isn't a village like that, is there?
- If there was a trail through there, maybe there would be. But the trail goes to the left. Anyway, after the bridge over the Uzh it turns right into forestry and further through farm yard, field, strictly along power lines, straight to the Krinka Lake.
- Son of a bitch, geographer! - Scout dubiously expressed his admiration. - You sound as if you were singing a song.
- You should have studied at school, - said Olga ironically. - Old one, we have caught our breath.
- Then let's go. - Andrei shifted his gaze to the Mechanic. - Tell me right away, where can you get into trouble?
- Everywhere, it is the Zone, - Kruger answered briefly and moved forward.
- But it's not a simple one, it's an artfully twisted one," Scout pointed out and gestured with some sort of elaborate gesture.
Unexpectedly, the cunningly twisted gesture had strange consequences. Scout lost his footing for no apparent reason, but instead of falling, he soared about two meters into the air and hung his head down.
- Like I said, everywhere... - The Mechanic gritted his teeth. - Now everybody hold on. Looks like we've hit the auger.</text>

    <text>The soft milky white glow of a large crystal seemed to flow across the mossy stone walls and across the ground floor, the only difference being that the shimmering "moon milk" moved not from top to bottom but vice versa. The glow drifted from the flat stone in the centre of the vast hall and reached the walls, rising up to the vaulted ceiling with a huge hole in the middle. The strange glow refused to crawl up the ceiling, no matter how brightly the crystal glowed. The owner of the milky white artefact called it the 'Glass Effect'. What caused this strange glow behaviour, the owner did not know. Nor did he know why the crystal, when he took it in his hands, changed shape, turning first into a strict parallelepiped, then into a cube, and then into a strongly elongated pyramid - almost like a bayonet. The third mystery was the crystal's reaction to the gravitational shock, which shook the entire Zone to its foundations every week. In the hours when the precursors raged in the outer sectors of the Zone, and then the Ejection itself, the crystal stopped glowing and became like a large diamond, intricately crafted and unusually transparent. When the brightest light of the Dead Noon flooded the outer Zone, the crystal became turbid again, and its usual glow began to gain strength. And along with the intensity of the milky-white glow, the artifact's ability to serve as a key between the sectors was also gaining strength.
The Master did not know why this was happening. What he did know was that in any state - whether a transparent crystal or a white artefact - the Key fulfilled the will of its owner. And that was far more important than all the riddles put together. The artifact easily opened a passage (in a crystal state - one, and on the peak of white glow - up to dozen) wherever its owner wished and kept it in the state of entering or leaving the Thirteenth Sector for as long as it was needed.
It was usually required to open briefly. Purely to exit or enter. So the host didn't have much trouble with the crystal. He didn't even think about the fact that the energy charge of the "Key" could be used up. He had suspected that it was happening, but he had never bothered to find out how much power the almighty Key was losing. Not once until preparations for the main operation began. The new "dens" were supposed to be made very wide and held for as long as possible. In addition, a great many of them might have been required.
Up to now, the Key allowed to create no more than a dozen transitions from the wormhole world to the normal one and keep them in the exit mode for about twenty-four hours. Perhaps the artefact was capable of more, but it lacked something. No matter how hard the master tried, he could not open the thirteenth corridor. Formally there were exactly thirteen passages - the "burrow" in Chernobyl-2 was the first of them, but in fact this passage should not be counted. It was not created by a crystal, which meant that the host could neither close nor restrict, for example, entry to the sector through this gate. The gate to the Thirteenth Sector in that place had always existed, and what controlled it, if not the Key, was still unclear.
It was these uncontrollable gates that started it all. Beastly instinct and chance helped the future owner of the crystal to come to it first of all psionics. To arrive, to find the crystal - the only artifact of the great Flash - and to become, in a hidden sector, the real master. And then... there was much more. Acquiring new kinsmen, a new name, or rather, the call sign - Engineer, a new meaning of existence...
But it all started with the gate.
"Strictly speaking, the rebirth from the ashes began with them. And before that there were long days and nights of excruciating transformation: both physical and moral. Perhaps if I had found the gate earlier, it would have been less painful. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have become what I had become. I would have degenerated into a mere controller and ended up in a military sweep or in the hot hand of Dutya. And, by the way, that's another big question: wouldn't that have been the best course of action? From a human point of view, I had too much to lose during the disaster. So much that further life simply made no sense. But unfortunately or fortunately, I have become a creature for whom all human motives are an empty shell. Unfortunately or fortunately... there's no way of knowing now. It's not even worth trying. It's like arguing if it wasn't better to stay in the womb. After birth, thinking about it is a waste of time. Quite a silly thing to do... ...but it's also very tempting."
Master of the Key touched the crystal as if he was transported back in time to a past difficult period when he was not yet fully aware of what had happened and who he had become. To be more precise, in a moment that was crucial for him...

...At first he remembered nothing but a flash. A blinding white ball of light, which rapidly rose above the horizon and then turned the world into a black and white frame, "lit up" the memory of his entire previous life. The engineer remembered nothing but the flash, but somewhere in the back of his mind fragments of memories remained. They were memories of things so important to him from before that he could not forget them. He had a family, he lived somewhere nearby, and he was happy. Nothing concrete, but as long as those embers were smouldering in his memory, he could assume that all was not lost. 
It was this thought that pulled him out of the half-forgetfulness into which he had fallen immediately after the shockwave that had followed the flash had swept everything around him and, picking him up, hurled the helpless man to the bottom of some cold and damp pit. It is difficult to say how long he lay in that pit without movement, without water or food, without even a desire to live. But eventually the Engineer opened his eyes and stood up. 
And rising to his full height, he looked at his surroundings and was horrified. The surrounding world, once so warm and welcoming, had turned into a bleak, grey squalor. 
There were mountains of junk, clouds of dust and ash, and leaden clouds in the sky. It was also terribly cold, as if there was no heat left in the world. Coldness reeked from everywhere: from the ground, from the sky, from the ruins, and from the creatures that tried to climb the rubble. 
The engineer looked up at the nearest pile of rubble, on which two men were crawling with difficulty. The dust screen prevented a good look at the pair, but the Engineer didn't need to. Somehow he knew who these people were. Or rather, former humans. The strange flash had changed them beyond recognition. Their bodies had become more flexible and stronger, but there was little thought left in their heads. All that ruled these creatures now were instincts. For example, they were now driven by hunger. They sensed prey and climbed up a pile of rubble to descend the opposite slope to where the prey was hidden. 
It was difficult for the engineer to know whether the insane creatures were preying on humans or humans like them, but in the main it did not matter. He didn't care about the madmen's squabbles. All he wanted was to get out of that creepy place and try to recover his memory. 
He hoped that his flash-induced amnesia, or the confusion of the crawling couple, or the similar problems of the many other people who were glimpsed in the ripples of dust, were temporary. 
He was almost certain that his personal condition would return to normal much more quickly than that of the others. After all, he had only lost his memory, not his mind as a whole. 
He could guarantee that everything would end well. It could not be otherwise! 
But the Alienation Zone, which had played a strange joke on humans, did not seem to care about all the hopes, certainties and guarantees of one of the people trapped in its trap. It had its own plans for the creatures that had survived the disaster. 
The engineer fumbled in his pocket for a case of spare spectacles, but did not take it out. He put his hand down slowly and, not knowing why, followed the pair of mad hunters. He walked carefully, careful not to stumble, jerking his hands up and down to keep his balance. He wasn't dizzy or dizzy, his arms and legs obeyed him, but his own body felt alien and unaccustomed aggravation of all senses made the Engineer feel out of place. 
However, it did not last long. With each step he walked more confidently and his heightened senses became more and more familiar. As they say, it was easy to get used to a good thing. Before he even reached the top of the rubble, the Engineer realized that his "renewed" body was in great shape, and his hearing, vision and sense of smell were as sharp as ever. He pulled out his unwanted glasses and tossed them aside. His hearing picked up the barely audible to the normal ear crackle of the case and the clink of broken glass. Now it sounded to the Engineer like the rumble of a collapsed shop window. His hearing even told him exactly which glass had shattered. The Engineer grinned. So far he still hadn't figured out what the mysterious flash had done to him, but he was beginning to like it. 
"Perhaps it really will pass soon," he thought to the Engineer, "for instance, if the flash only temporarily activated the body's latent capabilities. But until it passes, it should be used to its full potential!" 
Next came the keen sense of smell. The enthusiasm that had been building up was instantly gone. The smell reaching the Engineer was heavy, disgusting and... so alluring! The Engineer suddenly realised that he had been going for that smell from the start, he was just now realising it. He was going for the smell of fresh blood. He was drawn to the same place as those two madmen and... For the same reason! 
The engineer became very frightened for a moment. He felt a wild, overpowering hunger that overwhelmed his mind and will. In an instant his whole perception of the world was overturned. Now for the Engineer there was nothing left in the world but hunger - a beast trapped inside man. This horrible beast was tearing its way out, gnawing its way through, devouring its insides, and howling wildly, using its host's empty stomach as a trumpet. The eyes of the Engineer were enveloped in a murky veil, through which, like a filter, only one colour could pass: red. The only other colour in the world, however, was gray dust and ash, so the "filter" didn't have to bother. 
Once at the top of the rubble, the Engineer looked out over the view. The ruins of the houses loomed up ahead, so he could not see the line of the horizon, still engulfed in a milky white glow. But he did see what excited his new self the most. Prey. 
There was a hunt going on in a narrow hollow between two rubble. The two women, trembling with fear, were wriggling and dizzying, frantically trying to find a way out of the trap. The two crazies were joined by two more, with smudged faces and strange gloves, with fingers that looked as if they were five sizes too big. These clowns behaved in much the same way as the madmen. They gritted their rotten teeth, growled loudly, and held out their hands to their victims. It looked like a scene out of a bad horror movie, that's all. 
The four hunters, the Engineer noticed, were only reaching for one of the women. Why, it became clear when the Engineer looked more closely. This woman was wounded. Her right shoulder, side and thigh were drenched in blood. 
The intoxicating smell of blood hit her nostrils again. The engineer could barely contain the urge to rush down, push his rivals aside, and sink his teeth into the victim's throat. The only thing stopping him was calculation. Trying to wrest the prey from four madmen might have been a dangerous gamble. It was much easier to attack the second woman... 
The engineer did not think that these thoughts were wild and insane. Moreover, as soon as they occurred to him, they immediately became something like a new set of rules for life. No, the Engineer was not mad. That he knew for sure. He had simply become different. Who? He didn't care at the moment. All he cared about was the desire to satisfy his hunger. 
He plunged off the top of the rubble and lunged down, growling menacingly and waving his fists. At first he ran precisely at the second woman, but at the last moment it was as if a 'filter' had fallen over his eyes again, and his feet braked themselves next to the bleeding victim of the four mad hunters, who had already begun their feast, though the woman was still alive. The woman was still alive. The shock of the pain prevented her from screaming, she merely wheezed and writhed in agony, her eyes white with horror and pain. 
The engineer suddenly met his gaze with the victim's and froze for a moment. No, it was not what he read in the gaze of a man being devoured alive that stopped him. Such sentimental nuances did not bother him henceforth. The second pause was caused by something else. The engineer furrowed his brow as if trying to remember something, but remembered nothing and gave up the foolish task. While he hesitated, his rivals could gobble up the tidbits. 
Sensing a rival appear behind him, one of the 'smokers' turned around and extended a hand with an open palm towards the Engineer. The long fingers of the blood and dirt-covered hand were not the fingers of clown gloves at all. They were the fingers of a strange creature's gaunt hand. They were gaunt, too, and had long, sharp claws. It was unlikely this guy had been born that ugly, more likely the same flash was to blame for the change. 
"But then some kind of change could be in other people too!" 
The engineer forgot his hunger for a second, glanced at his hands and then hastily groped his shoulders and face. Apart from the waxy pallor of his skin, everything seemed normal. 
The second 'smoker' also raised a gaunt hand in a strange greeting, and the Engineer suddenly felt faint. He took a couple of uncertain steps backwards and stumbled awkwardly, flopping on his heel. 
He would not have been able to articulate what had happened, but he was well aware that he was not afraid of the 'smokers' or their mysterious weapons. Because he was wielding those weapons himself. And even better than those gaunt freaks. 
When the opponents returned to their wild feast, the Engineer rose from the ground and stepped resolutely forward. He wasn't angry, he wasn't going to scatter his opponents or engage in a fight with a secret weapon. He simply walked over and took what he wanted. And no one interrupted him. The madmen, whimpering like battered mutts, crawled away, while the 'smokers' simply ducked, spread out and left the best bits for the Engineer. 
As he satiated, the Engineer began to think more productively, but the new ground rules did not change. From now on, everything that had previously been unnatural became the norm. It didn't tie in with notions of human behaviour, but the Engineer didn't care about such subtleties. 
"Human beings are free to set their own boundaries and norms. For special people, they should be special too. I am special now, there is no doubt about it. And it doesn't matter why or why I became like this! What matters is that now I am a different person, I am a representative of a new species of humanity! And the fact that ordinary people are now just food to me does not contradict that. The strong have always eaten the weak. Now, literally too. The situation is normal." 
One of the madmen tried to stalk toward the bruised remains on all fours, but the Engineer saw his attempt and kicked the creature carelessly in the side. The creature whimpered and recoiled to the side, hitting some sort of thing in the process. The engineer looked at the thing and suddenly realized that it interested him. It was as if he had seen it long ago, in a past life. The engineer picked it up and dusted it off. 
It was a small powder box, made in the shape of an oyster shell. It had most likely fallen out of the victim's pocket. The engineer pressed a button and the flaps of the plastic shell swung open. A mirror was glued to the lid on the inside, as the Engineer expected. The engineer looked at his reflection in it and suddenly realized why the thing seemed so familiar to him. No, he had never looked into that mirror. But he knew the woman who did. He had bought the powder-box for the woman himself. 
The engineer held the mirror close to his face and stared blankly at his reflection. The terrible discovery should, in theory, have excited him, caused some kind of reaction: disgust, anger, shame... anything at all! But the Engineer felt nothing. No human emotion boiled over in his soul. What's not to say that it didn't boil over - it didn't even stir. 
"Human? - The engineer finally realized what he was seeing in the mirror. - Who, this... monster?" 
The engineer tossed the powder puff on the ground and stepped on it with his heel. At that moment he did not know what the future held for him, he did not know in what world he would have to live, and he did not know if he would live to see tomorrow at all. But one thing he did know, there was no going back. All the talk of a new species of humanity proved to be an empty fantasy. No new species had been created by the outbreak. It had only mutilated the old one. 
"And killed those it failed to mutilate." 
The engineer shifted his gaze to where the second woman had been sitting before the wild feast began. She was not there, and that was a good thing. The engineer couldn't remember exactly, but he suspected that he had known this woman in a past life as well. Eating her too would probably be too much. Even for the monster he'd turned into... .</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a4_doc_8">
    <text>... - Engineer," he called out in a mental voice. - Are you in the castle?
The grim scene of the vision flashed with milky white fire, faded into the distance, crumbling to ash. All that remained in the foreground was a pale face, with bottomless black eyes without whites and a maddeningly distorted mouth, the corners of which were laced with human blood. The face (or should I say muzzle?) of a mutant. Just a mutant at the time, a monster that only much later would receive the species name - psionic and a personal nickname - Engineer.
Yes, the face was exactly as he saw his reflection in the cracked mirror. The Master of the Key almost howled wolfishly, just as he had done in Chernobyl. A low growl escaped his throat, and the waxen face, with its black eyes, receded abruptly.
The engineer finally realized that this was no longer an illusion, and cut the growl short. The pale face opposite was no play of imagination or reflection in a mirror. The creature that looked like the Engineer (as well as three dozen other psionics) was real.
It was the Phantom, the Master's closest assistant. Where such a strange nickname came from, no one knew, not even he himself. Perhaps it was Ghost's talent for appearing silently, as if using the proverbial teleportation. Though who could understand the Zone? It might well have endowed him with such a talent as well. Ghost, like the Engineer, was in the past a fairly educated and shrewd man, and so turned by the will of the Zone is not a cunning and evil controllers, but something more. Why shouldn't the Zone give him a bonus? After all, it had granted the Engineer access to the Thirteenth Sector and handed him a crystal. During the outbreak, the Phantom had transformed into a creature of the same species, so he too was entitled to a prize. For example, to further evolve, to transform into something even more advanced.
"Exactly... Into something. - The engineer measured his assistant with a glance. - A creature without a face, without feelings, without a personality. Something that could manipulate the living and the dead but had no idea why it wanted to do so. After all, manipulating creatures and people in the Zone is purely a game, and we can not go outside of this cursed territory. Except in an extra dimension. But that, too, is part of the Zone. We live only in the Zone. Step outside and it's over. Which, incidentally, raises a reasonable question. Maybe Pryzak's ability to teleport is a hint that I'm going the wrong way. Maybe the future lies with the likes of him and not with my experiments with the crystal?"
The psionic man, frozen opposite, ducked slightly and lowered his black gaze. He had caught his master's thoughts and was probably in agreement with them, but was in no hurry to admit that the future lay with him. Nor was he in any hurry to develop his talent for teleportation. The Engineer, with or without the crystal, was more powerful, and Ghost was determined to serve his master faithfully. All this was easy to read in the assistant's mind. He was hiding nothing from his boss. Otherwise he would not have been the first assistant. When you and your master are telepathic, there is no hiding bad thoughts. Either you're genuinely loyal, or you're dead. There's no third option. Especially in the service of such a tough and tenacious minded master.
The engineer, indeed, became the master because he thought tougher, clearer and more logical than all the "converts", as they themselves called themselves. He was also the fastest decision-maker. And more often than not, he made the right decisions. He had his slip-ups, but there were more successes than failures. As a result, Psionics trusted him, respected him, and feared him. After all, decisions were often final. Those who disagreed with the Engineer (and those who persisted in their delusions) were instantly made dinner for the dozens of Cerberus dogs guarding the master's residence, or disappeared without a trace in the milky glow of the crystal.
No one knew what happened when the Engineer led the recalcitrant Psionics or inferior creatures into the glow. It was impossible to see anything through the walls of the light glass, and no one dared to catch his master's thoughts.
Personally, Ghost believed that the culprits were becoming dinner for the Engineer himself. And did not find in this version anything contrary to the laws of the Zone. The laws of creature survival among creatures and humans. In part such loyalty to Ghost was due to his master's loyalty, and in part to the fact that the Assistant often preferred to eat, as the saying goes, without leaving the cash register. Sector Thirteen was full of biomass. Busy creatures like the Engineer and his first mate often had no time to go hunting in the normal Zone, to comply with the unwritten rule of killing only humans.
In fact, this rule is long outdated. The myth that the meat of mutants is poisonous to all, except for the chain dogs of the owner (which he allegedly periodically injected into the withers of the antidote), was indeed a myth. The engineer had proven this a long time ago, but only shared the results of his research with Ghost. The other psionics and creatures were to be kept in the dark for the time being. When they had accomplished their primary task... let them gobble each other up as much as they liked. Keeping such thoughts from psionics was not easy, but so far both Ghost and Engineer have managed.
And, frankly, they had no time to think about such trivial matters. The new operation was in full swing. The Engineer was personally in charge of setting up access points to the outside world that had been opened by the Key, but the Phantom had no time for extraneous thoughts. The small but important operation he was charged with was not going too well. He had not been too successful. That was why his assistant had turned a deaf ear. Nothing catastrophic had happened yet, but the whole "vector of events", as the Engineer liked to say himself, was clearly not in the direction in which the psionics wanted.
- Two of our brothers are out of action," the Assistant informed him mentally.
"Unacceptable losses," the Engineer thought. - 'Four more have died in the Borderlands. We are too few to lose brothers and sisters in local skirmishes."
- Two of the walkers are resistant to hypnosis and one of the others is beyond our influence. In addition, all five are protected by Red Death artifacts. Only the Black Angel was capable of neutralising these artefacts, but...
- That anomaly has long since ceased to exist," the master finished his assistant's thought.
- "The Key is still capable of it," the Ghost hinted.
- I can't use the key for anything other than its intended purpose now. You'll have to figure out how to breach their defenses. Get the brothers to involve the controllers and dwarves, or get the humans to fall into some sort of psi anomaly. Think, Ghost, think. I have no time to waste. These people are dangerous, stopping them is important, but capturing the Frontier is more important now. If we don't do it within 24 hours, we'll have to take the creatures deep into the Zone and wait for the new cycle to begin. And it won't start for another three days. During that time, the humans could wipe out our army.
- It isn't easy to break through the Red Death's defenses," the Phantom hesitated. - Almost impossible. A cunning artifact that easily bypasses the energy traps. They don't call it the Joker for nothing.
- Then find a way to destroy the artifacts along with the humans.
- I'll try.
- Don't try, find! - demanded the Engineer.
- I'm terribly sorry... - a mind unfamiliar to the Phantom interjected into the mental conversation.
- Leave us, Ghost," his master ordered.
The attendant bowed again and stepped out of the light glass. If he wished, he could have stealthily eavesdropped on the conversation between his master and the unfamiliar psionic, clearly a novice. But it was not worth risking out of pure curiosity, and Ghost had no other motives. Master trusted his assistant with enough secrets, and those that he did not, Ghost did not need in his work.
- Am I in the way?
His thoughts came through the telepathic channel, and they were distinctly emotional. The palette was tinged with pain, frustration and fear of anomalies. Such colorfulness was uncharacteristic of full-fledged psionics. But psionics weren't foolishly walking into anomalies.
- Not stupidly, but as a conspiracy! What choice did I have? Everyone would get into the Aurora and I wouldn't?
- You flatter yourself. - The engineer grinned. - You have a gift like ours, but you are not yet a true psionic. You might never be.
- But I am no different from the humans in appearance!
- That's what I'm thinking. Everyone must make use of what the Zone has given them, without forgetting what they have left of their past lives.
- And what it took away. - A tinge of sadness flashed in the thoughts that came from the outside.
- I think we've been through this before," the Engineer commented sharply on the last thought. - During our first conversation we had. I see no reason to repeat ourselves. The less time you waste on me, the sooner I can begin to discover new access points which will automatically extend the boundaries of our world. Which means that we will be able to live where we want to. Do you finally understand, or shall I say it again, and slower?
- I understand. Well, then, just to recap. Your psionics are too arrogant. That's why they're easy to kill.
- Your friends aren't the best walkers in the Zone either. How did you end up in the auger?
- That's the way it is. But all the walkers made it to the path in one piece, and the psionics suffered irreparable losses. I don't know how many will make it out of the Auger, but the survivors will certainly continue the raid. They have Yampol ahead of them. A little more and they'll be halfway there. You're clearly losing this round.
- Stop being impertinent! - thought the Engineer irritably. - I have no time for trivialities! My assistant will take action. If you try, you can read in my mind the outline of a plan for how the Psionics are to operate in the future. I'll allow it.
- It's not an easy read.
- Your problem. If you're afraid of dying with the rest of us, you'll have to do your best. I don't have time to explain. And I don't particularly want to.
- Who was that woman? Why can't you forget her? There were hundreds more victims after her. So why? Because she was the first? Or is there another reason?
- You are thinking the wrong thing, you two-legged leech! - the Engineer was indignant.
- You said it yourself, strain. - There was a grin creeping up from the telepathic voice in the outer world.
- You try that again and I'll blow your brains out!
- That's very scary. All right, I'll confine myself to the business at hand. So, what have your psionics got for us? Ah, I see. Not much.
- You've had enough. You'd be better off "accidentally" leaving the group behind at the last minute and carefully escaping the danger zone.
- I got this. All right, I gotta go. The group is starting to come to their senses.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a4_doc_9">
    <text>Raindrops fell slowly from the grey sky, almost like snowflakes on a windless New Year's night. Falling on the cracked glass of the filtered mask, they broke into thousands of tiny splashes, which a little later merged again into large drops and flowed into a gray puddle. From the parterre, from the ground itself, or rather from the old scraped asphalt, the puddle seemed to be a real sea. There were real waves with foamy bubbles, and where the raindrops fell, the gray sea threw out intricate, crown-like fountains and swirled little whirlpools.
The only thing that was a problem was the angle. Lying with one cheek in such "sea" it was difficult to appreciate all its monochrome beauty. The left eye could see the "sea" at an angle of ninety degrees, and the right one was contemplating murky depths. But if it were not for the rising water level, one could admire this dull, but hypnotizing microcosm to infinity.
Andrew tried to get out of the stupor, water had already started to pour into his nose, but willpower alone was not enough. He involuntarily inhaled a portion of turbid water, coughed, but did not manage to roll over: his body did not obey.
"It's a laugh and a sin to drown in a puddle! - Lunev concentrated and tried to pull his legs up to his stomach and arms to his chest.
The attempt succeeded, but it did not improve the situation. Face of Andrew was still lying in the gray sea.
Suddenly some external force came to the rescue. It easily dragged Andrew away from the puddle, turned him on his back and pulled the mask off his face. With a sharp headache Lunev's eyes went dark and his ears filled with dense cotton wool.
- No, you were even prettier after the Sandblaster," someone else's voice rang through the cotton in his ears like a bell. - But you're still handsome now. You've been through a lot. You're alive, aren't you?
The buzzing in my ears faded, and my vision began to clear. At the same time the stranger's voice lost its metallic hue and became almost recognizable. A little later, Andrei felt his body. At first he felt a slight tingling and warmth in his stomach, then the heat spread to his chest, arms, legs and finally to his head. As soon as the warm wave reached the top of his head, Old knew that he had his body again. He lay there for another minute, watching the silvery drops falling from the frowning sky, then gathered his strength and first rolled over onto his side and then slowly sat down on his knees.
The attempt to raise his head to examine the man standing opposite ended in failure. A sharp pain in the back of his head made him drop his head onto his chest. Andrei massaged his neck and tried again. This time he managed to raise his head, though the pain still got in the way. After coping with task number one, Lunev tried to fix his floating gaze, but once again he was unsuccessful. He had to squeeze his eyes shut briefly, then blink and squeeze again. After a few exercises the dizziness was almost gone, and Andrew finally realized who was trying to make contact with him.
- How long have I been lying here?
- Half an hour, for sure. - The man squatted down. - What have you gotten yourself into? You look like a canteen cutlet. Except you don't have flies all over you.
- At least I don't stink.
- Not yet. - The man grinned and held out his hand. - Hello, Old One.
- Hello, Major.
Andrew clung to Major Brazhnikov's hand, like a drowning man to a lifeline.
- He's healthier than you, fact!
Major Brazhnikov helped Andrew to get up, reached the rusty carcass of the tractor, grown into the mud not far from the road and sat down on the step.
- The auger's been hit," Andrei said cautiously touching his face. - It felt like riding inside an iron box down a steep hill.
- "Auger?" - The Major hesitated. - 'Haven't heard of it. Something new?
- Haven't you noticed that everything in Sector Thirteen is new?
- Sector? - Brazhnikov looked around. - This is Yampol, wake up!
- How did you get here?
- Same as you.
- So... the path is both the Zone and the Thirteenth Sector, so the mechanic says.
- And under Chistogalovka, in Chernobyl-2, then what?
- And there the Thirteenth is already in its pure form. Its hidden part.
- Too complicated for me.
Brazhnikov picked up some rusty fragment and threw it into roadside bushes. There was a rustling in the bushes. The major raised his assault rifle and took aim.
- Hey, you hear, military, with your own! - A groan came from the bushes. - It looks like a broken leg! Give me a hand!
- Scout? - the major, without putting down his machine gun, took a couple of steps towards the bushes.
- Es, ityz. - The stalker groaned. - It hurts, dammit!
- I'll help you.
Brazhnikov went deeper into the bare, but still dense bushes, and soon pulled the incessant grunting Scout out of them.
- Everything hurts, in your mouth! - Scout gritted his teeth. - He was bruised all over! "The Jokers didn't fucking help!
- Without the Jokers you'd be silent as a fish now. - Major sat the stalker down beside Andrew and clarified: - Like a dead fish.
- Olga!" agitated Old. - She was left without an artifact!
- Well, bless her memory," said the Major quietly. - I do not know what kind of screw is in it, but, judging by your condition, it is hardly possible to survive without the Joker in it.
- My bad," Scout hugged his shoulders and exhaled. - Pity about the girl. Pity about the girl. A fine-looking bitch.
- You goat," muttered someone in the ditch to the left of the tractor.
- Did you hear that? - Scout got wary. - Or was I imagining it?
- Yes," said Brazhnikov. - Mermaids whispering from the puddle. I'll go fishing.
Quickly the major went down into the ditch and almost as quickly got out on top. The "catch" turned out to be more substantial than one could have guessed. Brazhnikov caught two "mermaids" in the mud at once. One, Tatiana Sergeevna, got out almost by herself; another had to be dragged, then by hands. Olga was injured more severely than the others. She had no serious fractures, but she had a lot of bruises and internal injuries, I'm sure.
- Scout, give her back the Joker," Andrew ordered.
- Isn't it too late?
- I told you ... asshole," Olga gritted through her teeth.
- Take it, take it," the stalker hung the bag with the artifact on the neck of Olga. Tatiana helped to tuck the thing into Olga's sinecap. - Get well.
- The Mechanic remained. - Andrei tried to get up. - Major, can't you see him?
- I wish I could never see him. - Brazhnikov turned his head. - But it is not the fortune. There, waddling. He's the furthest away. Yeah, lucky for you. Like copper cauldrons. I got through all right, didn't I? Only half an hour later.
- What's that got to do with it? - Scout muttered, squinting at Lunev.
Andrew was silent. Once more to saddle the stalker had no strength.
- Well, Slavs, are you alive? - Arriving Mechanic sat down on the roadside, casting a weary glance over the group. - And the Major came up. Good.
- Isn't it customary for Germans to say hello? - Brazhnikov measured Kruger with a distasteful glance.
- The costs of barbaric upbringing, - Max calmly parried. - I was born in Kazakhstan. My grandmother was exiled there from the Volga Region in the forty-first century. You got through without any problems?
- Well, so. - The major illustrated his words with a vague gesture. - Shot a bit. But the trail was clear. What kind of auger did you get into?
- That one. - The mechanic drew a spiral in the air with his finger. - Lifts you two meters in the air and starts screwing you like a screw. With constant acceleration. If you don't regroup, it can spin you so hard it can tear your arms and legs off. It's like a merry-go-round, but with a horizontal axis.
- The way you describe it, it looks more like the barrel of a rifled weapon, - remarked Brazhnikov. - And you were like bullets in it.
- You might say so. We were lucky to get a short barrel, it dragged us only a hundred metres.
- What hundred yards?! - Scout was indignant. - We were almost gone on a kilometre!
- On inertia. - Kruger nodded. - But it would have been enough without the Jokers.
- Olga was without her artifact and she survived.
- She landed in the dirt. She would have been tired of scraping it off, like the Old One, with her face on the asphalt.
- All is clear, - Brazhnikov drew a line. - Shall we go further?
- Let me wake up, - said Andrew. - I must have a sip of energy.
- And one hundred grams... - Scout grimaced and rubbed his leg, - painkillers.
- You'll be patient. - Brazhnikov crouched down and felt the stalker's leg. - Bones are intact, you were afraid for nothing.
- I'll stay, - said Olga softly, - you will not go far with me.
- Refuse. - The old man shook his head. - 'An hour's rest. If you don't get up, Scout will drag you back to base and we'll go on.
- He'll get up. - Major Brazhnikov took the first aid kit out of his pouch, then his Joker. - We'll cure it in a moment.
The Major spent the entire resting hour working his magic on Olga, Andrei and Tatiana were dozing, leaning against each other, and the Mechanic and Scout were bickering quietly, simultaneously observing the terrain.
Several times mutants, mostly wild boars and pseudo-dogs, appeared in their field of vision; once a group of some walkers flashed on the edge of the forest south of the road, and twice on the horizon, presumably over Novoselki, a flock of unusually large birds soared into the sky. When the flock soared into the grey sky again, the mechanic managed to raise his rifle and examined it through the telescopic sight. It turned out that they were not birds, but humanoid, but not bad flying mutants, nicknamed by the people "batmen".
In general, everything in the Zone was as it was in the Zone. Abnormal life went on as usual, practically not interested in a fairly vulnerable at the moment a group of walkers licking their wounds on the outskirts of the village of Yampol, long ago turned into ruins.
Not that such a state of affairs did not suit the group, but at the end of the break Old tried to understand why the Zone suddenly gave the walkers such a long respite.
- We're on the trail, but you can still see us," Andrew said, turning to the Mechanic as he finished stating his doubts.
- And you'd better keep your head warm! - Kruger grinned. - No one is attacking, be happy then.
- Nothing to be glad of, - said Brazhnikov looking narrowly at the edge of the forest. - Fact.
Old and Kruger stared at the dark gray thicket. Five seconds later Andrei rose sharply and checked his weapon.
- The halt was over. Up. Major, how's Olga?
- I'm fine. - Olga limped over to the trio. - If you don't run... I'll make it.
- That's good, move it! - Lunev cast another anxious glance at the edge of the forest. - Brazhnikov, at the tail-end. Let's go!
It was impossible to tell what was happening at the edge of the forest, but they did not need to. It did not matter if there was a danger lurking in the forest, or if there was a clear peril lurking in the forest. In either case it made more sense to avoid it. Shadows flickered among the trees, and bushes and young trees swayed. On several occasions deadwood crackled and some vague sounds were heard from the thicket, either the echoing of words or the grumbling of beasts. This could be a sign of movement of a large family of wild boars or a couple of pseudo-giants, but Andrew could not rule out the worst possibility. A raiding party of some faction could be moving in parallel with the group. If the controllers were leading it again, sooner or later the pursuers would have to attack. They might not be able to avoid that kind of danger if they wanted to, but they might find themselves in a better position than they were now by pushing.
For a while, as long as the invisible path coincided with the highway, it was easy to control the terrain on the left. The group simply kept a "left turn" and, at the first sign of the convoy's leader, scattered along the right shoulder, aiming for the forest. When the road led the walkers to the main R-10 zone road and the trail took a sharp right turn, the source of probable danger was left in the rear and the whole burden fell on the followers. Brazhnikov and Lunev had to keep back, straining to stare into the brush along the side of the trail and into the silhouette of the ruins of the old car wash, which were darkening about half a kilometre to the left of the highway.
Closer to the dilapidated bridge over the Uzh River it became even more difficult to keep an eye on things. The river floodplain to the left, overgrown with tall bushes, and the dense forest to the right offered the enemy an excellent chance to get close to the road. Needless to say, the walkers on the bridge were easy targets. A novice sniper's dream.
It was good that by this time the group had completely forgotten about the consequences of the meeting with the auger and got into a working rhythm, and so they passed the bridge in a matter of seconds. Even Olga, who was still limping and generally moving, as the sportsmen say, "at will", did not prevent the group from passing the dangerous section at a good pace.
Ahead of them were the remnants of houses and buildings of Cherevach. But as promised, after the bridge the mechanic led the group to the left. The path now ran along a long shoal, almost devoid of vegetation, from which both the opposite bank of the river and the bridge were clearly visible. The dense sand was no more difficult to walk on than the tarmac, and the good visibility allowed a little relief, although, on the other hand, stomping on the open ground clearly disfigured the group.
In reply to the remark about this, made by Brazhnikov, the mechanic threw up his hands.
- There are no variants but it is even for the good. We go to the forestry, get to a small grove, but then we go back to the field. Kilometre and a half as on a palm would have to go. So, in short, practice.
Whether or not the major was satisfied with the Mechanic's arguments remained a mystery. Brazhnikov turned to the river and stood watching the bridge and the opposite bank till the group disappeared in the wood. Then the Major caught up with his comrades and went behind again.
It was not too far to the "forestry" and the group passed it without any problems. The group passed through the non-existent forestry without tripping over the remains of buildings. A vast ashes of the old office and outbuildings had been covered with brush and sunk under the layers of needles, rotten grass and river silt brought there by the floods.
- Now to the farmyard and across the field. - The mechanic pointed straight ahead and then left. - Tentatively the course to the lake. Or to Novoselki, as one likes.
- Wait a minute, - said Olga on guard. - Something is not right up ahead. Tatiana, you have the best detector, would you mind?
- Yes, yes. - Tatiana hastily took out of the pouch anomaly detector. - You are right. Anomalous background is slightly increased ahead, but I can't say anything definite.
- I can," Brazhnikov said. - Strictly on a straight line we will not reach the collective farm yard. There's a big hole there, the Mousetrap. We'll have to go to Cherevach. Mechanic, do you think it'll work?
- The trail covers the edge street and the entire collective farm. We can go through there. Dangerous, of course, ruins have always been full of dwarfs, and one can get lost and run into poltergeists between combine harvesters and other seeders at the station; it's better than getting into hole, though minimal.
- Good choice," hissed Scout sarcastically. - If it's not the salt in the pit, it's the cauldron. No chance of no trouble at all?
- No.
- So we'll go, - decided Andrew. - Lead the way...
...What Mechanic called a street was rather a clearing. The ramshackle, partially ruined houses were buried in dense thickets, and in summer it was probably impossible to see them, while what used to be a street itself was overgrown with sparse young growth and weeds, which stubbornly stuck out, even withered and then a thousand times soaked in the endless rain. The less hard grass had long since fallen and rotted away, making it more difficult to wade through the stubborn weeds. My feet slipped repeatedly through the mixture of rot and mud.
- There are vipers here in summer... - Scout ran his hand over the top of his head. - There you go. And they're all fat, muzzled. Yellow ones with black zigzags. Or the other way around, depending on how you look at it.
- Big ones, with a zigzag? - Tatiana shuddered. - They're Caucasian vipers. They shouldn't be in these parts. I mean all of Polesie.
- You can have and enter whatever you like, but I'm talking about what I've seen. Sometimes you walk like you're walking on bicycle tyres, there's a lot of hissing going on.
- Maybe I'm confused about something? - Tatiana shrugged her shoulders.
- Zone," Brazhnikov muttered.
- A convenient excuse. - Tatiana waved her hand. - Anomalies, mutants, mysteries ... all this did not appear out of nowhere. For instance, mutants have appeared only as modifications of the traditional local inhabitants. Wolves, pigs, rats, dogs... and so on. Not a single mutant based on reindeer, say, or walrus.
- I wonder what the pseudo-giants were in their past lives? - The Major grinned. - Or bloodsuckers.
- Humans, - Tatiana answered confidently. - As well as controllers, snorkels and other bipeds.
- And poltergeists?
- The same.
- No," said Andrei. - With the latter it is more complicated. That's the kind of thing that's a bit of a mystery. As for the snakes, they do exist, and not only in the ruins. Many of them can be found in bogs and forests.
- Achtung, citizen scientists. - Kruger turned sharply and held up his hand. - Quiet! Here we go.
No more remains of the former collective farm yard and the machine and tractor station than the rest of the village, the only difference being that the scrubland was not as dense here. The shrubbery grew only by the fence and around the repair shop, which surprisingly preserved not only the roof and rusty gates, but also a few panes in the small windows. Scout peered through the ajar gate and said there were even machines and workbenches with vices inside.
- How they hadn't been stolen, I don't know.
- Who needs them? - The mechanic grinned. - Tools, I understand, but vices... and the background here is decent. This radioactive rubbish will not be accepted even for scrap.
The group rounded the workshop and, as if on cue, stopped. Ahead, in the distance, stretched a large, brown with dirt and stunted grass field, but to get there, he had to walk between the dozens of scattered as if any carcasses of machines, tractors, combines and all sorts of trailed devices to these rusting masterpieces of agricultural engineering.
- Damn soul, it's a real maze! - came out of Scout's mouth.
- Follow me," said the Mechanic, with an expressive look at the women. - And don't take another step away! But if you get lost, don't shout. Stay and wait, I will find you. Otherwise you'll make trouble... we'll get tired of fighting back.
- Do not get lost yourself, - answered Olga. - I've been walking here too.
- How long ago?
- Last year.
- You'd be surprised," Kruger promised, and grinned enigmatically.
- About what?
- You'll see.
- The labyrinth changes after each Ejection," Brazhnikov prompted. - Technology is the same, but stands in new places.
- How do you know? - Kruger, dissatisfied that the intrigue died on the spot, turned to the major.
- I know." Brazhnikov nodded ahead, "Lead on, tracker.
Advice of Mechanic was useful, but the one who listens to smart advice does not go to the Zone. Only stubborn people, convinced that they know the ultimate truth and do not need anyone's advice, go to it. That is why the same Olga, 'only' decided to bypass the carcass of an ancient tracked tractor, not on the left, as the rest of the group, but on the right, found herself in a dead end and was unable to return. She wound ten laps around the ill-fated CHTZ in the thick sticky mud, but could not find the passage where her comrades had hidden. All paths led to a dead end, the only way out of which was back to the rusty tractor. In the end, Olga sat down helplessly on some beam next to the iron hulk and began to clean off the clods of dirt from her shoes.
Having cleaned one boot, Olga paused for a moment to catch her breath, when suddenly she felt someone's eyes on her. Someone was looking out of the gray depths of the labyrinth and was hardly just admiring. Rather, it was assessing, estimating how tasty lunch would be today.
Olga fumbled for the safety of her assault rifle and tried to find her adversary using all her senses, including her abnormally keen sense of smell. The result was not encouraging. The enemy was near, but where he was hiding, Olga could not understand, no matter how hard she tried. The situation was even more precarious than on the clear island. For some reason the enemy was slow, but that sooner or later he would attack, the girl had no doubt. Olga got up slowly and took a couple of steps along the path treaded in the mud around the tractor. No, she did not hope to find a way out of the trap at the last moment, but to sit idly by waiting for an attack was beyond her strength. And maneuvering in combat was always a good idea.
Once on the other side of the tractor, Olga stopped and listened. Her gut was still unable to pinpoint the exact location of the enemy, but her ears seemed to pick up something. Through the faint rustle of drizzle and splash of puddles a rustling sound penetrated. The sound came directly from the pile of shabby hardware that blocked the view of the repair shop. Though, perhaps, the rustling was coming from someone not hidden inside, but on the other side of the pile of scrap metal.
Olga pointed her weapon at the pile and slowly moved forward. After the October mess, Olga had never been out in the Zone with her beloved flamethrower, the legendary Smoker disappeared at the very moment when General Ostapenko gave Olga a chance to start a new life. Still, Olga often regretted that her passionate love of fire toys was now limited to making "Molotov cocktails" and using standard incendiary ammunition. There were times when a flamethrower would have come in very handy. For example, now. One shot and the enemy would have jumped out of their hole like a darling. Olga even imperceptibly sighed, imagining how good it would look to see the mountain of metal doused in flaming fire-aggression. And how the mutant, set on fire with it, would have screamed.
Olga gritted her teeth. An old mental wound was making itself felt. An almost irresistible desire to scorch the whole damned Zone to the ground flared up in her soul with a giant torch that instantly smoked her mind. Olga raised her rifle to her shoulder and slammed a long burst into the centre of the pile. The shaft's heavy bullets didn't ricochet, piercing through tin and iron and getting lost somewhere in the depths of the pile, but they hardly went through. Olga was aware that she was only wasting ammunition, but the relapse into pyromania was stronger than common sense. Only when the magazine of the rifle was empty did the girl wake up and sharply lower the weapon, almost dropping it from her suddenly weakened hands.
Feeling this strange weakness, Olga realized what was happening. No enemy was nearby. And from a distance, with the help of telepathy, no one was trying to attack her. She wasn't lying to the Old One; the controllers really couldn't sense her, and when you can't sense your enemy, you can't hurt them. So it wasn't about mutants. It was about the abnormal energy of the labyrinth itself. Olga remembered Brazhnikov's words about the changes that occurred in the labyrinth after each Ejection.
"That is, after all, a typical sign of an anomaly! Albeit rare, but essentially the same as all the others! And what do anomalies put pressure on, if not destroy physically? That's right, on the psyche! On weaknesses, all sorts of punctuations and fears! And even though my psyche is special, "adjusted" by the Zone, but ninety percent the same as that of everyone else! So I'm in a bind."
Olga hardly lifted her hand, trembling from weakness and nervous exertion, and slapped herself audibly on the cheek. It partly helped. The surrounding anomaly immediately became clearer and almost unintimidating. After the second slap, the strength returned to her body, and when Olga mentally (and very firmly) told herself that it was time to get out, the labyrinth gave way and opened before her the very passage she was searching in vain.
Proud of herself, Olga had managed to take only a dozen steps down the passageway when, unexpectedly, the Mechanic emerged from the nearest corner. Seeing the damsel, Kruger wiped the expression of concern from his face and glued the usual mask - a mixture of arrogance and condescension. True, there were other feelings in Max's gaze after all. First of all, relief that everything had turned out all right. For some unknown reason, he did not want to lose Olga.
It was hardly a hidden sympathy, it was more an order from Ostapenko, and still Olga was flattered by the special treatment. Not the brutally handsome Kruger, but at least the hardened practitioner and cynic Ostapenko had some mysterious plans for the strange-looking girl. Perhaps there was nothing good in it, and the general needed a juvenile delinquent pyromaniac only for such raids to the horns, but for Olga it was also an achievement.
"You don't have to live your whole life by hating the Zone. At some point it will pass, and another incentive will have to be found. A professional value for this role is quite suitable. It's the best incentive I could think of. A prime example of professional value is the Old One. He probably doesn't even remember who he was before, or why he came to the Zone. And it doesn't matter. And what tests he had to go through in the Zone, also unimportant. What matters now is who he has become. And he became one of those who are commonly called the living legends and professionals extra-class. Ostapenko himself seems to be surprised at how he managed to find, and even get into sole use of, such a gem. So, perhaps, and I ... someday ... ".
- Well," Max interrupted her musing, "have you made sure you don't want to relax here?
- I have not relaxed. - Olga looked at the mechanic with a challenge. - I checked something.
- Interesting to know what? - Krueger grinned.
- This labyrinth is a psi anomaly, right?
- You had to spend money on a whole shop to find out? - The Mechanic's gaze turned sly. - You could have asked, I would have told you for free.
- What you would have said, I know! - Blushing slightly, Olga declared. - You'll see for yourself. I've already heard it!
- All right, don't quibble," Kruger asked in a conciliatory tone. - I told you we shouldn't go around here alone, didn't I? I've tried it myself. I got into as much trouble as you did once. I spent 24 hours circling two planters in a figure of eight.
- Yes? - Unexpected frankness of the mechanic melted a little soul ice, and Olga softened.
- Yes. - A grimace of superiority slipped from the Mechanic's face for a second. - Such an anomaly. It does not look like a killer, but it straightens twists no worse than an ironing press. Well done. You made it in half an hour. That's a record. Can you tell me your secret?
- No, I can't. - Olga looked away.
- It's your right. Come, the people have been waiting.
People, shifting on the edge of the field, were not only waiting, but also worried, and therefore, when they saw Olga, they rejoiced. At least it seemed so to Olga. Even Tatiana, still recently looking at her young companion askance, smiled, genuinely happy that Olga is all right. Only Old looked with condemnation, but did not arrange a reprimand. He, unlike the Mechanic, knew for sure that psi-anomalies, like mutant hypnosis, were not a problem for Olga, but only temporary difficulties. Perhaps, if her comrades had not been around, Old would still have said a word or two to Olga, but only about the girl's sluggishness. Olga herself realised that of the half an hour she had spent in the labyrinth, twenty-nine minutes had been spent on foolishness. The psi anomaly had not so much deprived her of her ability to think as it had struck a delicate mental chord, and Olga succumbed to the hypnosis not of the anomaly, but of the "music" she had played.
Olga waved to her comrades and added a step, but literally three meters from the group, she suddenly stumbled and froze, almost collapsing face first into the mud. Literally. In the farmyard, plowed by all kinds of cataclysmic events, the mud could hide any traps, so it was easy to stumble here, but Olga lost her step not because she caught on an obstacle. She was stopped by a sudden feeling of mortal danger that threatened the whole group at once. It was no longer a silly concession to hypnotic pressure, but something more useful in a practical sense. The signal was sent by a gut that unmistakably determined that there were controllers in dangerous proximity (but, incidentally, shamefully missed the psi-anomaly).
Olga sharply threw her frightened eyes on Andrei and whispered just one word: "Run!"
- To the fight! - instantly oriented Old. - Brazhnikov, forward march! The rest of you follow him! Mechanic, follow me! Assemble in the woods at the power line pylon! On the double!
Major and Tatiana, as the most disciplined members of the group, did not ask a single question and did not stay put even for a moment.
- The controller leads the dwarfs," Olga warned the Old One and also rushed after Brazhnikov.
Kruger, hearing these words, instantly took up position behind the hulk of the wheeled tractor to the right of Andrei and took aim at the nearest exit of the labyrinth. Only Scout remained in his special pose as usual. He glanced after the fleeing companions, then assessed the situation in the rear and finally stared suspiciously at Lunev.
- I don't understand, what was that just now?
- Don't be stupid. - Andrew shook his head to the right. - Run to the woods!
- Again? Everyone's a champion, and I'm the stupid one, huh?! Why are you so jumpy, can you tell me?
- Olga has smelled the inspector," the Old Man explained patiently, though forcefully. - This time he's not leading the bandits, but the dwarves.
- Where did he dig them up?
- I don't know, in the local cellars, maybe. What do you care? Run, don't delay!
- I'll stay. I can shoot as well as you can.
- You've got a lung shot," the Mechanic reminded me with a chuckle. - Run, dead man, while you still can.
- Look, mercenary. - Scout squinted at him angrily. - Doesn't take much strength to pull a trigger. Ferstein give you a hint?
- He sent... Ostapenko's group. - Andrew spat and barked, to the envy of any sergeant: - Scout!
- Got it! - Scout slung the submachine gun on his shoulder and hobbled into the field. - Jumped on one, got away on two. You should have just said so!
He jerked off in the same direction as the first half of the group, but did not get far. Something rumbled in front of him and suddenly there was a huge fountain of mud. Scout involuntarily recoiled, flopped on his heel and shook his head in a daze. When the mud and the gray water dust that rose with it settled, a rusty bulldozer blade protruded from the ground in front of Scout. There was no doubt that it had not grown in an instant from the rain. Scout looked around and tried to estimate the trajectory the ton-weight iron thing had taken. It came out of the centre of the labyrinth.
- Hey, fellows! - Scout yelled. - The controller didn't bring dwarfs, but giants of some sort!
Andrey and the Mechanic quickly got close to Scout and helped him to his feet.
- They won't aim," Krueger concluded. - But they won't aim themselves. They'll be hitting in the fields.
- It's a hell of a lottery," observed Old. - But there's no way around it. Come on, let's go!
- What about me? - South fussed. - I've got... a lung!
- A pendel? - The mechanic suggested. - To make it go faster.
- Danke. - Scout sprinted towards the forest and soon overtook the Mechanic by fifty metres.
At first the "artillery bombardment" with farm machinery parts was sluggish. Invisible behind the maze wall, the telekinetic mutants were clearly trying their hand, trying out how much weight and at what range they could hurl. But when the group had covered half the distance, the enemies got a taste for it, and iron projectiles of all shapes, sizes and weights began falling from the sky like hail. The nastiest thing was that neither running zigzags nor other tricks could add to the chances. The dwarfs' "mortar" fire was not aimed. It simply covered a certain area. Exactly the area the walkers raced across.
Heavy tractor rollers, track links, frame parts, body suspensions, combine augers, excavator buckets and even entire cabs flew with an ominous whistle and crashed into the ground at various distances from the walkers, raising not just fountains and waves but tsunamis of thick mud, which knocked them down and almost made them unable to move. Twice Lunev and once Scout had to literally dig each other out from under the thick layer of mud, and when they reached the forest the "final shot" nearly covered them both. The tractor's support roller sliced through the nearest pine tree like a razor, and the tree fell with a groan precisely on the walkers. Thanks to the reaction of Andrew, who dragged his companion out of the danger zone, Scout got away with a couple of splinters in the forehead and a reddened cheek - Lunev was whipped by a branch of the fallen tree.
Barely out of the woods, the walkers regained their footing and very soon moved a relatively safe distance away. Just to the power line pylon that Old had mentioned. The unique construction, rusting here idly since time immemorial (all wires were stolen by the first stalkers who preyed in the exclusion zone after the Chernobyl disaster), by some caprice of the Zone has not yet collapsed and served as an excellent guide for many walkers. Nearby the pillar, complete silence reigned. Deafening splash of mud waves, muffled clumps of earth and whistling "shells" reliably cut off the forest.
- ß... for today... run from a heart attack... and in a hundred years... won't catch up," Scout said, barely breathing. - Do you... have... any... spare trousers... ...spare trousers?
- Clean yourself up. - The old man swiveled his head, trying to find the others. - The mechanic... have you seen him?
- I thought you were... about Tatiana first thing... ask. - Scout marked a chuckle.
- Me and Krueger were running.
- No, you didn't. Oh! But I see yours! Here they come, all three of them!
- She ain't mine.
- Yeah. Scout grinned. - That's what they all say. I don't know who they're testing. Friends or fianc?s or themselves. It's like a test to see how strong your feelings are. Doesn't work, mind you. Friends will talk you out of it, the bride will make eyes at you, but you'll get married anyway.
- I'll keep that in mind. - The old man's face showed that he was not going to pay any attention to Scout in general or to his fabrications in particular. Andrzej didn't want to offend the man who had just helped him out of the mud captivity. - Now shut up.
Or wanted to, but in a way that didn't offend him too much.
- I've only been dirtier once, and that was in my mind," Olga said as the trio approached the meeting point.
- We were going to the lake, weren't we? - Tatiana asked hopefully in a trembling voice.
- Ladies! - Scout hissed contemptuously. - Only to wash themselves.
- And Andrei, are we on the trail? - Brazhnikov asked his question. - Are we there? Where is the mechanic?
- I'd like to know myself where this guide is... to the bright future. - Lunev glanced at the surrounding bushes. - And we are not off the trail, that's for sure. The trail here is almost a kilometre and a half wide. Max said.
- He said it was getting narrower," Scout reminded him.
- Anyway, we're still on it, I'm sure.
- You mustn't argue, we must wait till Mechanik will judge - said Brazhnikov, but noticing sour expressions on Andrejs and Scout's faces he lost his temper - or else... Or ... won't we wait for him?
- He'll come, - said Andrew not so sure. - He'll come!
- He'll come, Old Man," he said quietly. - I'm not sure, but... I think I know where the mechanic is.
- More conspiracy theories again? - He glanced sternly at the stalker.
He waved a hand and grimaced.
- No, why ... I am not completely crazy! That's not what I mean. I think I saw Max get splattered with a big piece of that stuff.
- You sure you saw it? - Lunev frowned.
- I'm not sure, I tell you! You remember what a scary thing it was. A tractor wheel whistled over my ear... just like that... - Scout almost put two fingers together, leaving a centimeter gap. - Any lower and half my skull would have been blown off.
- Not a wheel, a roller.
- It's all the same! Anyway, I didn't have much time to look back, and I didn't want to. But I did turn around a couple of times. Here I noticed that at first the mechanic was almost behind me, and then suddenly from the sky such a frame with a square cabin collapsed, and that was it. I never saw Max again. No, that frame... from a combine harvester, I guess... could have fallen not on the mechanic, but just between us! If he suddenly slowed down - no problem! Only, I'm afraid it fell on him. He wasn't slowing down, he was racing like a real horse, no gullies in his way. That's the stuff.
- Really, it is rubbish, - agreed gloomily Andrey. - He had gone through so much, had worked himself out of every situation, and now he had died so awkwardly. He deserved better.
- More what? - Scout glanced skeptically at his leader. - Drop a pyramid on him?
- Don't be sarcastic now. - The old man glared. - He deserved to live, I'm sure, though we weren't friends. Duty and a happy life. And you "pyramid"... You're a half-assed clown, Scout. Cheapskate!
Scout remained silent, he sighed, and made a sympathetic grimace.
- In war as in war," Brazhnikov, who had kept silent until now, summed up. - We'll remember him when we come back. But for the present ...
- Let's move on, - Lunev answered in his stead. - Even if it's not as bad as Scout imagined, we can't wait here for the Mechanic any longer. We have to keep moving. Kruger, if he's alive, can make it on his own. He'll be there before we are. Let's go!</text>

    <text>The gray mass of mutants proved to be a reasonably organized army, but only when two basic commands were followed: "Forward" and "Backwards". Waves of hideous monsters swooped down on the walls of the citadel, climbing up, clawing at any irregularities, losing their attacking spirit along with hundreds of "heads" and rolling back under the cover of the buildings surrounding the warehouse complex. The first two or three repulsed attacks the defenders of the citadel celebrated with a joyful "Hurrah!", but after the fourth and, especially numerous, the fifth wave it became clear to people that the mutants had no intention to quit what they started and sooner or later get on the roofs of warehouses and then inside the citadel. More and more of the attackers appeared as batmen and controllers, forcing the other species to activate their hidden reserves and leaping onto the rooftops almost without a run. The monsters that couldn't fly or jump had a chance to climb over walls and gates over the corpses of their kin. The mountains of ugly bodies had formed a veritable three-meter-high rampart around the warehouse complex by dawn. Whoever was driving the mutants forward clearly had no regard for their losses.
Targeting the monsters was easier with dawn, but that could not solve the problem. Reinforcements were pouring in, and not just any reinforcements. Not just any reinforcements. Several hundred boars and nearly a hundred pseudo-giants formed the main thrust of the new assault wave, which moved in a little later than the other creatures and attacked all eight gates at once. The heavy, thick-skinned boars picked up speed and slammed into the gate in dozens, leaving deep dents in the solid iron. The machine gunners in the towers had to spend a lot of ammunition to stop the boars, but as a result, the northern and northwest gates still collapsed, and if it was not for the BMP, propped them from the inside, the breakthrough mutants in the territory of the complex would have been inevitable. The "cleaners" who had taken cover behind the vehicles opened heavy fire from underbarrel grenade launchers and managed to repel the monsters. But not for long. Very soon the wild boars returned, but then soldiers of the commandant company came to the rescue of the barrier troops, who until the last moment were running around the perimeter in soap and foam and bringing ammunition to the soldiers. Now the "commandos" were given the opportunity to prove themselves in real action. They dragged several boxes of hand grenades to the gates and staged a competition to see how far they could throw them. Given the limited supply of grenades in the depots, the measure was forced, but the situation called for it.
Seeing that another wave had subsided, General Ostapenko, who personally monitored the situation in places of possible breakthrough, ordered to save the remaining grenades until the next attack and shifted attention to another front. Inside the citadel, right on the square in the middle of the warehouse complex, a mortar battery was deployed under the watchful eye of Bibik. And it was deployed quite a long time ago, but began shooting only a quarter of an hour ago, when anti-aircraft gunners on the roofs of warehouses and in the turrets installed on the Humvees machine guns more or less settled the problem of attacks "batsmen".
Ostapenko had no trouble climbing over the pile of flying monster bodies torn up by large-caliber bullets and made his way to a relatively free plaza. Seeing the general, Bibik tried to give the command "Ten-hut!", but Ostapenko gestured to the Colonel's statutory impulse.
- How are the mines brought to you? - The general pointed at the piles of stinking bodies around the perimeter of the parade ground. - Why don't you clean that shit up?!
- It's all in the works! - Bibik glimpsed the fidgeting around the mortars.
- Colonel! - shouted the artillery officer. - Ready!
- Fire! - Bibik waved his hand and plugged his ears.
The light mortars squawked the "dog waltz" in patches and in a second repeated the piece, but more harmoniously. The third salvo was almost a single, slightly howling growl.
- Aye, all in," the communicator beeped. - One on the right flank, make the correction.
- Understood. - The colonel gestured to the artillery officer and handed him the communicator. - Corrector says one barrel is misfiring. Keep in touch, fix it.
- Yes! - The officer took the machine and rushed to the position.
- Don't forget to bring the phone back! - Bibik shouted after him.
- Do you think it will help? - The general asked in a low voice.
- We'll hold it till we run out of mines. - Bibik waved his hand pointing to the west. - At the very beginning of the mess "cleaners" from three "AGS" worked the "hole". Asphalt in a dust, instead of platz - a crater, and a hole as was, so it is. And the beast crawls out of it without any problems. No, it's not realistic to fill in the hole, because... there's no hole.
- What does it mean?
- You know what it means," said Beaker a little angrily. - I am to blame! My nerves are failing me.
- I do not know, but I guess," said Ostapenko quietly. - And you should take some valerian, if you lose your nerve. Do you think this "hole" is an access point to the Thirteenth Sector?
- Well, it's an odd coincidence, of course. - Bibic shrugged his shoulders. - They'd just sent a group, and then, lo and behold, the mountain came to Mohammed. Everything coincided too precisely, but, on the other hand, maybe we guessed it, maybe the situation had just ripened?
- Or someone reported our guess to the Thirteenth and they decided there was no point in waiting," Ostapenko added thoughtfully, nodding.
The battery howled and howled again, and Bibik had time to think over the general's words.
- I even know who might have reported," said the colonel when it was time for another correction.
- I'm not so sure about that, though. - The General shook his head. - 'Yes and it doesn't matter. Not yet. It's more important to get out of this cauldron now.
- That I understand. - Bibic grimaced and snapped his fingers as if trying to catch the elusive thought. - Except... if there's an opening from the Thirteenth, and Old's group is going to the Thirteenth...
Ostapenko stared at the colonel with interest and even nodded subtly, as if to encourage Bibik: "Well, well, think.
- Maybe the raid should have started from here? - Beebeek suggested that, not too confidently. - Maybe we should try it ourselves? Mow the creeps down with massive fire, throw a ton of explosives in the hole, and go to the Thirteenth. Counterattack.
- No. - Ostapenko's face has a grimace of slight disappointment on it. - You're missing the point, Bibic. There's only one way out. You can't enter the sector through it.
- Yeah? - Bibik thought about it again. - 'Actually... that's right. No matter how much we pound, it's no use. All the mines and grenades explode on the surface. I mean, in our... sector... or whatever you want to call it... in our dimension or something?
- Now you're thinking right," the General said approvingly. - That's why the Old One's mission becomes vital to us. If Lunev manages to figure out what's wrong and finds a way to rectify the situation, we'll survive. If not, we won't.
- He will," Bibik said confidently. - He will.
- I think so too. And also...
The general did not finish his thought, because Bibik suddenly jerked forward and his whole huge mass fell on the commander. Ostapenko could not stand on his feet and the officers found themselves in the parterre. There was no malice in the colonel's actions; on the contrary, if not for his throw, the D-3 base might have been left without its only general. It turned out that a large flock of "batsmen", up to forty heads, still managed to break through the barrage of improvised air defense and rushed at a low angle, just a few meters from the ground, straight to the position of the mortar battery. Ostapenko and Bibik were exactly in the way of the flying creatures.
When the pack dashed past, the colonel jumped up and tried to open fire, but only fired a couple of shots and lowered his "kalashnikov". The monsters clashed with the fighters and it became too dangerous to fire. Bibik tried to find a communicator, but remembered that he gave the machine to the battery commander, and grudgingly spat.
- Duty officer, - Ostapenko muttered from the stalls. - The special group to the parade ground!
- Aye! - the loudspeaker of the general's communicator answered in a toy voice.
- I'll stretch. - Bibik put the bayonet knife to his submachine gun and moved resolutely to the place of the fight.
- Colonel Bibik! - Ostapenko stood up.
- ß. - Bibik turned around and looked at the general in such a way that he changed his mind to stop him.
- Careful!
- Bingo!
Bibik took the high start and started accelerating like a locomotive. By the time he crashed into the thick of the scrum all his eight pound live weight was rushing at the speed of a cannonball. Not surprisingly, Bibik knocked two of the mutants out of the scrum like pins, simply by crashing into them with his shoulder and chest. Another colonel at random hit one with the buttstock, so that, having collapsed, the monster did not move any more, and the last one, which finally extinguished the kinetic energy of the living express, Bibik pierced through almost through with the bayonet. The bayonet went into the creature's lean belly like butter, and just as it did, almost effortlessly, severed its spine.
"The Batmen sensed the formidable support that had come to the rescue of the mortars, and instantly redistributed their forces. At once six or seven mutants soared into the sky and, performing somersaults, synchronously spun on the Colonel.
Bibik was not frightened by their acrobatic number. The colonel took a couple of steps to the left, then sharply stepped forward and twirled his machine gun above his head in outstretched hands. The maneuver got rid of one - it flew exactly at the colonel, but after Bibik stepped forward, the beast was forced upwards again, almost scraping its nose on the asphalt. And the 'formation techniques with weapons' pretty much spoiled the mood of the others. The mutants were undoubtedly expecting a human to fire, and were quite prepared for it - flying headfirst with clawed paws (hands would have been more appropriate, but hands can not be clawed), and even "corkscrew", to use aviatorial terms. Shooting at such small and mobile targets really would be necessary, carefully aiming and therefore losing time. But Bibik, contrary to all assumptions and wishes of mutants, acted unconventionally. He wasn't afraid to let the monsters come within striking distance and engage them in hand-to-hand combat.
Two mutants suffered arm fractures in the mill, which represented a revolving machine gun above Bibik's head, and one nearly lost his head - a bayonet knife slashed the monster's throat and cut it to the spine. The fourth got a glancing blow from the buttstock, but it was pretty bad too. The creature shrieked and crawled backward, flopping to the ground. The two remaining mutants circled like their first cousin, rising to a height of ten meters again. They must have expected that the first one would be waiting there, so they hesitated for a moment when they did not find their leader, glancing around. It turned out to be an embarrassing and, more importantly, fatal fall. A special squad arrived and with a couple of accurate shots shot the creatures hovering over Bibik's head. Both "batmen" fell within one meter of the colonel, in the same place where the notorious first one had fallen. A few seconds earlier he had been shot by General Ostapenko personally with an almost silent "rifle cutter".
Bibik gave way to the spetsnaz and, having switched on backwards, stepped back to the general.
- Good shot. For the brass.
- Put aside the irony, Colonel. - Ostapenko's voice didn't have the usual sternness. - Not all generals are fatuous careerists.
- I'm not being ironic. - Bibik shrugged his shoulders.
The exchange of pleasantries was interrupted by a new cannonade. As soon as the spetsnaz had cleared the position of the rest of the infernal squadron, the surviving mortar men continued firing. They did so in good time. It was noticeable how the fighters on the roofs of the warehouses and the machine gunners on the towers came to life. Most likely, taking advantage of the pause in the battery's work, the enemy brought the fresh forces out of the shelters and went for another attack.
The conjecture was confirmed exactly in a minute, when the long song of mortars' chorus was joined by numerous rattles of machine guns, the bass measured rattle of large caliber and claps of grenade launchers.
Ostapenko nodded at the roof of the nearest warehouse. Bibik moved first. Climbing to the roof was no problem, but what the officers saw from the observation point boded very big problems in the future.
The D-3 base in its original boundaries no longer existed. All of its sectors were reduced to smoking ruins: from the airfield and the location of combat units to scientific laboratories and a commercial sector, which was adjoined by a vast area of tent city, where numerous trailers, campers and tents inhabited stalkers and guests from the Big Earth. Smoke billowed over the ruins, blocking most of the view, but the gaps between the smoldering ashes in the drizzling rain allowed one to see more than just what was happening on the former base. To the south and east, visibility was more or less decent, almost to the grey horizon.
To the east, beyond the sparse woods and ravine-covered fields, at about the level of the village of Gubin, which remained only on the maps, a flame was blazing in the sky. What could be burning there, and how the mutants had managed to set that "something" ablaze, was anyone's guess. To the second question, however, the answer could be simple. The arsonists were not creatures. The forest or the remains of the settlement's structures had been set on fire by humans to stop the countless army of monsters spreading out of D-3 in all directions.
That the mutants were gradually spreading over the outskirts of the Zone was confirmed by other "species". First of all, of the nearest approaches to the citadel. The mutants were slowly approaching, using the smoke screen as a camouflage, and were approaching not only from the side of the "burrow", but from other directions as well.
Further confirmation that taking the warehouse complex was an important, but not primary, task for the mutants was the southern view. A fairly decent grouping of mutants was concentrated in the wagon and tent city, and they were clearly aiming for the citadel, but more of the creatures were showing their backs and tails to the D-3 defenders, slowly advancing towards the outer edge of the three-kilometre-deep frontier.
Bibik picked up the powerful marine binoculars confiscated from the stocky warehouse commander and tried to get a good look at the vanguard of the advancing troops on the Great Land. As the colonel had expected, ahead, under cover of pseudo-giants and several attack groups of boars (ambiguously lined up in a wedge), were the same human-like controllers in oversized robes. They were moving slowly, or even slower, but they weren't going to stop yet. Bibik mentally estimated the most convenient place for the new frontier masters to draw the new border and came to the conclusion that it would be the bank of the Teterev river. And by all appearances, Bibik guessed the intentions of the leaders of the infernal army. As soon as the vanguard disappeared into the coastal sparse forest between the villages of Oranoye and Zorin, the bulk of the horde advancing southward stopped and began to scatter through the numerous lanes, gullies, lakes and buildings. Hardly for the purpose of mopping up - more likely in search of food, but in this case the former did not interfere with the latter.
The mortars fell silent again - the commandant company was completely exhausted and the process of bringing ammunition to the battery had failed. Bibik was distracted from examining the situation. Convinced that the difficulties were temporary and purely technical, the colonel continued to look around, but now he tried to see through the smoke the source of all trouble - the "burrow", the supposed exit from the Thirteenth sector. For a while the smoke was too thick and all Bibic could see was the roof of the nearest barracks, but soon a light but persistent breeze blew and for a few seconds the burrow became visible as if in the palm of his hand.
- Colonel, your contact! - The commander of the special group appeared on the roof. - The mortar man transmitted.
Bibik silently took his communicator from Pashkov and slipped it into his pocket.
- Thank you.
- Here we gave them a light! - Excitedly shining eyes, exclaimed the lieutenant. - And teach this "mill"?
- Later, Pashkov. - Bibik again dug in the eyepieces of binoculars.
- Exchange of impressions later too, - Ostapenko added coldly. - Go through the positions, Lieutenant, collect data on losses. And warn everyone. There will be a new assault soon.
- Bingo!
- It is right, they will go in now, - finished studying the situation round the "hole", said Bibik. - They want to take us by surprise. They are saving their forces stealthily.
- Concealed gatherings of the strike group? Where?
- In the barracks. - Bibic pointed to a two-story barracks nearby. - The batsmen are moving out of the circle on foot and into the barracks.
- That's not good," the general said worriedly.
- 'That's right. They suddenly fly up in a flock and their antiaircraft regiment is not enough to fight them off. And when they land in the courtyard, they'll be in trouble. We could get our own guys in the crossfire. We'll have to fight them hand-to-hand. Pistols and shotguns at most we can use.
- It's not good, - Ostapenko repeated. - Hand-to-hand is half the battle. "Batmen aren't the most toothy of creatures, and they don't use weapons...
- Their claws are five centimeters long and as sharp as knives. They're not bad for Special Forces, they're kevlar-clad, but the cleaners only wear armour. Could get hurt... like the mortar men. Mutants ripped three of them to shreds while I was juggling a machine gun.
- Yes, casualties are inevitable," Ostapenko agreed firmly. - But I think most of the regular units have enough training to dodge the claws and teeth. That's not what I'm talking about. I am concerned about the cleverness of the mutants and the rudiments of tactics in their actions. It is as if they are commanded by humans.
- I've seen a few," Bibic agreed. - They look like commanders. Not sure they're human, but they don't look or act like... well, not mutants, exactly.
- The missing link in the transition? - Ostapenko grinned.
- Or vice versa. - Bibik didn't understand the hidden meaning of the general's phrase. - An advanced version of controllers. At a glance, you wouldn't know that they are mutants. They behave almost human-like, and their brainwashing is much cooler than that of the controllers. Such spies break into the commercial sector, and it takes a while to distinguish them from the locals. It's Kazakevich's dream. Only in reverse: not humans with mutant abilities, but mutants disguised as humans. If they mentally command the landing party, the "batsmen" can put up serious resistance. Knives and spades won't do the trick.
- There are quite a few stalkers among civilians," Ostapenko said thoughtfully. - They have guns.
- They will not give them up.
- We are not going to take them away. They may go to the yard and destroy the flying landing force with us. I don't think they'll refuse to help.
- Well, yes, they do help themselves," agreed Beebick. - I'll talk to them myself, they won't refuse me.
- Yes, go and organize this militia, before it's too late, and take command. I'll manage on my own here. I'll try to get in touch with the group as well. Maybe there'll be a better connection from here.
- If there isn't one, there won't be one at all," shook his head. - It's a satellite line.
- This is an odd situation. - The General drew his communicator out, twisting it, as if he were hoping to find a button on the casing that could boost the signal or something.
- If they've already entered Sector Thirteen, that's not strange," the Colonel said. - You see, nothing gets into it, only out... nasty stuff.
- Not yet. - Ostapenko shook his head. - Alright, go on, you 'batman's menace, go to work.
- We'll press them to the southern wall, - Bibik warned. - Don't send ours there, that they won't be hit by the cartridge.
- All right. Good luck!
Bibik saluted and hurriedly strode down the humming stairs. The general, probably not realizing it himself, said the main thing. When you fight an enemy for whom there are no rules other than "kill the enemy or die", but at the same time, led by sufficiently intelligent commanders, the training, powerful weapons, physical strength and courage are not enough to win. At least minimal luck is still needed.
"On the other hand, luck loves not only the lucky, but also the stubborn. Judging by the fact that we're stuck in this ass, we can't be counted among the former, so we'll fight until this capricious lady decides that we're worthy to be among the latter. Get used to it, eh?"</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a5_doc_8">
    <text>The forest to the north-west of the dangerous village of Cherevach was dull. Especially in contrast to the enigmatic village and the "cheerful" field beyond its outskirts. Pines and pines. The occasional shrubbery. There is springy pine litter underfoot, boughs and roots that everyone has tripped over at least once. Above, between the pine trees the sky was grey with drops of rain. That was all. No one attacked, no one bothered, no one even sniffed somewhere in the bushes. Animals, people, birds had disappeared as if they had never been there. It was as if the Zone had taken time out to see how the walkers would behave without a guide. Won't they go astray, or abandon their hopeless venture before it's too late.
Andrieu had no intention of going astray. He already understood the route of the group led by Mechanic and he could finish the raid without any hints from his former companion. The only thing Old lacked was his intuition for the path, which he had managed to hone during the month of wandering along the trail. On the other hand, Andrei was still the more experienced walker and knew the Zone well. Where Mechanic felt the trail, Lunev relied on basic logic and knowledge of the terrain.
Let's say now the group was moving towards Krinka Lake. The mechanic said that the trail went past the lake, to the left of it, but after a kilometre it turned left, and just before the village of Korogod it went north again. Lunev did not even have to strain his brain to understand that another hidden, and at the same time comfortable enough path through this part of the Zone simply does not exist. Yes, from the point of view of ordinary stalkers, it was a rather unsafe route, but that was the point. Whoever walked the trail had no fear of mutants or anomalies. He was only worried about not giving away the location of the entrance to Sector Thirteen to outsiders. Well, and not to strain himself too much. Like this forest, for example.
"Not a march, but a walk... - Andrew chuckled," from one anomaly to another.
That ahead very soon will meet some new anomaly, Lunev did not doubt, and therefore did not hurry. The comrades needed to rest and recover. For about half a kilometre the group walked slowly, gradually building up strength and trying to scrape off the lumps of dirt. They managed to get the mud stuck to their shoes quickly enough, but the camouflage stains on their clothes would not come off.
- It will come off when it gets dry, - Brazhnikov said commenting on the fruitless efforts of Tatiana. - Don`t waste your energy, it will come in handy.
- I can't... so grubby...
- But we blend in with the terrain. - Major grinned and caught up with Andrei. - Not in a hurry?
- Do I have to?
- How shall I tell you. - Brazhnikov shrugged. - You left after dark, but I left only at seven, and even that... I didn't leave, I crawled away.
- We heard the explosions, - Andrei nodded. - Something serious?
- Nah, it's nothing. A hundred thousand mutants got into the base and started making a fuss. The garrison, of course, started shooting back.
- Why didn't you say anything?!
- When was the time to talk? We have diarrhea and scrofula, too.
- Tell us more, - demanded Andrew. - Seriously, up to a hundred thousand... came? And from what direction did they attack? How did they manage to break through the perimeter? There's a barbed wire and machine guns.
- Well, maybe I was wrong about 100,000. Who's counting them? But if I was wrong, it was less, that's a fact. And they broke through... they didn't come out of nowhere. Shot out like warm champagne foam, right in the middle of the base, and started creeping up the nooks and crannies.
- In the middle of the base?
- Pretty much. In the plaza next to the airfield. That's where our weapons hangar and squadron headquarters are.
- We took off from there," said Andrew thoughtfully. - Was it foggy? Greenish, in the shape of a ring.
- I don't know. I couldn't see it myself. Beebick enlightened me, when we went to the warehouse complex and started to barricade.
- Back where?! - Lunev stared at the major. - Is it really that bad?
- Even worse. If our troops are still holding on to the depots, then the base is all that's left of it. And we don't know for how long. Ammunition and food there for a month, no less, but it is if you just sit and shoot sluggishly through the loopholes. It will not work so with mutants. After all, every half an hour they will come storming in. Two or three soldiers at a time will haul away, after a hundred attempts at all the walls of the shooters will not be enough - and then the end. Without support or evacuation, the chances are nil, that's a fact. But at HQ, those overeager bosses, you know, they only think fast if there's something to steal. It takes them to consult with NATO, to coordinate with Belorussians, and then with Muscovites...
- We can't evacuate by helicopter, the weather's lousy, and the batsmen...
- Exactly. So what? They'll either plan a breakthrough or... a bombing raid.
- What about the garrison? They didn't all die while you were securing the depots.
- We lost up to a third of our manpower. The rest are on the walls. Not only that, there's up to a thousand more civilians. But you know HQ is scared as hell of the Zone. It's easier for them to bomb D-3 to smithereens and blame it on the Zone.
- Is there any way we can interfere? - Lunev has shifted to a business-like tone.
- Tell me, - Brazhnikov looked attentively at Andrei, - the General has not sent you here by chance. On purpose.
- Well, yes. - Andrew grinned mirthlessly. - Only he forgot to say what the target is. He has a manner. First he sends you something, which is indecent to say in front of the ladies, and then he waits for the result.
- He only does this to some people. - Brazhnikov rubbed his cheekbone and sighed. - It's the way he sends you and Bibika. He only sends me with specific tasks.
- Don't be jealous. - Andrzej shook his head. - It is easier for you.
- And it's more interesting for you.
- Well, yes, especially when you feel that a lot depends on you, but what exactly... not a clue.
- I'd like to help you. - The Major threw up his hands. - But it's all too complicated for me, you know. I know how to fight, but to conduct investigations and figure out the enemy's tactical schemes...
- Strategic too.
- Besides... it's not my thing. But if you want... I'll give you some ideas. They may not be worth anything...
- Speak up, of course," Andrei encouraged him. - A glance from the outside is always worthwhile.
- Bibik called the place of the mutants' breakthrough "an access point to the sector", and the scientists the general managed to bring to the citadel were arguing about some "spot of contact". I first thought - discussing tyres, but then I realized: they were talking about the same problem as Bibik. Get it?
- Sector 13?
- Well.
- Why are we going in the middle of nowhere, if the access to the sector was opened at the base?
- What good is it if it's open? There's beasts coming through there, they'll trample us in a heartbeat. No, we're going the right way. We'll get to the Thirteenth from the rear, far from the front line, and what we'll find there... that's a question for your brain. My helmet hanger isn't very imaginative. That's a fact.
- Yes, it is a problem. - Lunev stared thoughtfully at his feet and then stopped.
Brazhnikov glanced at Andrew in surprise, then shifted his gaze to the coniferous ground and squatted down to get a better look at the stopped object. It was neither a mine nor a tripwire, but it was worth stopping. The Major threw back his head and scrutinized the bare boughs of the nearby pines. Nothing unusual he found, and in the meantime, the thing that interested Old was none other than "Spike" - an artifact produced by the anomaly "Burning Fluff". Normally this Zone-altered vegetation hung from low trees and bushes in long whitish strands that were easy to spot and get around, but now there was nothing like it nearby. However, just as there is no smoke without fire, so in the Zone there were no artifacts without anomalies. There is a Spike, so there must be a Burning Fluff nearby, the only question is where.
On the whole, the anomaly was not the most dangerous. Lunev, for example, had been able to pass through entire groves of such trouble. If you move slowly and smoothly, the vegetation did not react, even allowing, in a sense, to admire themselves. The sight was exotic and beautiful in its own way. But as soon as one speeded up a step or made a sudden movement the insidious mutated trees and bushes immediately shot small burning spores that got on the exposed areas of the body and burned not weaker than drops of concentrated acid. The pleasure was below average.
Brazhnikov beckoned Andrei to stay where he was and slowly moved forward to explore. He was back in a minute.
- There, behind the bushes, was a lane of youngsters, all in spats. It goes to the left and to the right for about 300 metres, we will be tired to go round.
- We may not get tired, but we will get off the track.
- A fact, - agreed the major. - We have to risk it.
Both put on their masks, hoods and gloves without talking.
- There's a nuisance on our heels, Old Man! - Scout came briskly up to the vanguard. - Sneaking about like cats, only I heard them anyway. Why don't you have your faces covered?
- 'I would advise you to do the same,' said Andrei. - And keep still. Further to the grove of Burning Fluff.
- Ah, I see. - Scout took up the mask. - Wait, what about those... in the back?
- We'll warn them too, don't worry.
- No, I don't mean the broads, I mean the ones that sneak around. If they attack, we won't be able to run away, will we?
- If they do, we'll have to fight.
- How? No quick change of position among the Puch, no hard kick if it comes to a fist fight. A dozen of them would hit one point and burn through their clothes and their kevlar! Some lads told me how one of them burned through his armour!
- They won't, - confidently objected Brazhnikov. - It's a coddle. Fear has many eyes. If you're scared, go behind the pine, take a piss beforehand, so you don't wet yourself.
- Oh, what a joke! - Scout grimaced, snorted contemptuously, and pulled on his filter mask. - What's the next thing you don't joke about? I'm wearing a gas mask, you can say 'Permission to smoke'. That's your military humor, isn't it?
- You should get a job at the mill," Brazhnikov calmly suggested. - You can easily grind a sack of flour a day with your tongue.
- There's someone there... is there! - Tatiana and Olga almost at one voice said on the same level with the men. - They are catching up!
- Is the controller driving? - asked Olga Olga.
- I do not feel, - she answered and pursed her lips.
- What do we care? - Scout interfered. - Let's go, while there is a time gap! They'll make up for it in a jog, but we have to crawl. Gases, ladies!
- What do you mean? - Tatiana was surprised.
- Again a command?! - Outraged Olga.
- Masks on and hoods with gloves, anomaly is ahead, - resolved their doubts Andrew. - And no sudden movements.
- "Burning fluff?" - Olga guessed. - Eh, a flamethrower here...
- That's right, - agreed Brazhnikov. - A forest fire would be handy now. At the same time we'd shake all unwanted people off our tails.
- Fire? - Tatiana looked at the major with distrust. - Do you really mean it?
- And you are against it?
- It is barbarism!
- Barbarism is when people kill people. And a forest fire is a forced measure, a way of survival.
- It is outrageous! - Tatiana looked at Olga for support.
- Fire is not always the enemy. - Olga looked away. - Especially in the Zone.
- Olga knows what she's talking about," Scout snorted. - I remember a stalker with a flamethrower, named Smoker, once roamed the Zone.
- The wind blew in the wrong direction," interrupted Andrei. - Major and Scout, you follow. Ladies, follow me.
The time gap Scout was talking about disappeared as the group entered the grey realm of abnormal vegetation. "Burning down," like grey bast, hung from the branches of trees, mostly young pines, everywhere and left fairly narrow corridors for passage. Here and there gray strands of gray intertwined to form a solid wall and then had to make intricate turns or lie on the ground and crawl. And all of this had to be done extremely slowly, as if to imitate a Baltic rapid response group at a KVN festival.
The pursuers, meanwhile, came close to the burning grove and even ventured into it, but they did it too hastily. A slight breeze seemed to run through the outermost trees, and the Burning Down on their branches came into motion. The abnormal vegetation shot spores almost silently, but after this volley the noise was guaranteed. In this case it was painful shrieks and mate, by which one could easily determine not only the distance to the pursuers, but also their number, and suggest what kind of uniform they were wearing.
Andrei waited for Olga to level with him and looked questioningly at the girl.
- The telepath isn't with them," she whispered. - He is somewhere near, but these fighters go themselves.
- Take Tatiana," commanded Andrew. - Do not turn anywhere. In fifty meters there is an old clearing, go on it to the north up to the fallen down post and wait for us.
- And you?
- We'll shoot.
- "Pooh doesn't like that," Olga warned.
- I know, but if we do not close the matter now, these bandits will follow us all the way to Chistogalovka.
- Are you sure they are bandits?
- Nine to one. They're the easiest controllers to deal with, so they got Duty to let the bangers onto the trail.
- What if you're wrong? What if it's someone more serious?
- Not wrong. I recognised some voices. It was the same ones in the woods near Kamenka. Everybody, get out of here.
To be sure Andrew repeated the order with a gesture, waited till the ladies continued their difficult way through the dangerous bushes and slowly moved in the opposite direction. Scout and Brazhnikov understood without further ado when they saw their commander. They spread out and lay in line with Lunev, each about fifteen meters from the leader.
The bandits came into view after about five minutes. They too tried to move slowly and smoothly, but this did not add to their vigilance. The Archangels had clearly not expected the walkers to dare such a trick as a firefight in a forest full of Burning Fluff. Apparently, the bandits sacredly believed in tales of the special burning properties of abnormal spores and could not imagine that anyone would dare to disturb the peace of the abnormal forest, bringing down on his head his burning anger.
Andrei signalled his comrades not to fire until the whole bandit group was drawn into the thicket, and when that happened, he was the first to open fire.
What began in the ranks of the bandits when Lunev's comrades took the initiative could not be called panic, it was too weak a word. Those of the Archangels who fell to escape the bullets received a powerful volley of searing spores, while those who froze in place still fell to the ground, but already dead. Only three tried to return fire, but only one of them risked falling and rolling. The other two fired as they went, backing toward the edge of the grove. Understandably: in the thicket of Burning Fluff, this was not the best way to move and fight. Both were soon caught in the thicket of gray strands hanging from the nearest tree, and neither their clothing nor their masks helped. Even from a distance you could see how their skin blistered, how their faces swelled up, their eyes were swollen, their hands were puffy and covered with crimson sores. But the two men died not from pain or ulcers, but from suffocation. Their faces and hands were followed by swelling of the larynx and the swelling blocked oxygen to the lungs. If there had been a doctor in Lunev's group, he would have said with certainty that these men had not actually died from the burns, but from a severe allergy, which was caused by substances penetrating the affected skin.
Within seconds, only one fighter, the one who was not afraid to fall and return fire, was left of the pursuing group, which at first numbered about a dozen bayonets. By all the rules of survival in the Zone, it would have been better to finish him off, but Andrei ordered him to retreat. Not because he pitied the enemy. Simply fighter acted competently, and even the three of us to destroy it could spend a lot of time. And time, as it turned out during the conversation with Brazhnikov, was in short supply.
The trio slowly rose, staggered backwards and soon emerged from the perilous thicket into the normal forest.
- Tough," Scout said, surveying his gear. - Like a dog on thistles, that spores. How am I supposed to clean it off now?
- With the knife, - advised major. - You made sure that all tales about spore's special acidity are a pure ponce, didn't you?
- No, but what about these... that swelled and burst?
- No sooner comes out of the anomaly already making up new tales, - turned to Andrew, Brazhnikov grinned. - What a breed! Who burst, what are you talking about?
- Well, not burst, - wheezed and fell down dead.
- They went straight into the bast - feel the difference. These braids are like live ones, they can get under your clothes. Even in your trousers, if you don't have a zip. Well, in there...
- Hello, Terror, if it's in your trousers. - Scout took out his knife and peeled the spores off his clothes.
- Let's move," said Andrew, pointing in the right direction. - We'll clean ourselves as we go. There'll be something like an automatic car wash with brushes ahead.
- Where, what? - Scout shook his head.
- On the glade. Look at all that young growth. We'll have to cut through it like a jungle.
- Ah, that's as usual. - Stalker took hold of his knife and waved, as if loosening the hand before a sabre-rattling.
- And where are these? - Brazhnikov glanced round. - Did you send them here or somewhere else?
- "They're here," was heard from the bushes on the right, "as we agreed, waiting by the fallen post.
The ladies emerged from the thicket.
- Good. - Brazhnikov hid a smirk.
- That we're not in the doghouse, Scout added.
- End of the chatter," commanded Andrei. - Knives to the fight, we'll fight our way through.
- Brutal destruction of the young growth," the restrained Scout reserved the last word.
The group's formation had changed again. Olga was at the back of the group. All the masculine strength was required to transform the virtual path into a real one. Andrew suspected that on a fairly wide stretch - the trail here was surely no narrower than a hundred-meter wide clearing - there would certainly be a pathway treaded by someone else. The inhabitants of Sector Thirteen or the Mechanic, for example. But it might take more time to find an old path than to cut a new one. There was also a risk of bumping into someone from a hidden sector on the old one, or... well, you never know...
Andrew did not make up any more ideas and simply got to work. After all, the lake was not too far away, about half a kilometre, and after Krinka the path would go back through the relatively light forest.
By the time the exhausted group reached the lake, the mud on their clothes had dried and was beginning to fall off in chunks. Some of the mud that had covered their faces and hands and penetrated under their combat suits had dissolved again, and it was now stinging unbearably, getting on numerous abrasions and scratches.
Seeing water in the gap between the trees, the ladies shrieked softly, but in unison, and rushed towards the lake. It was impossible to stop them with a simple shout, so Lunev trotted after. Scout and Brazhnikov reached the shore a few meters to the left of the trio.
None of the men shared the ladies' enthusiasm. Lake Krinka was considered a bad body of water. No one was in a hurry to assign it high status of anomaly, but still stalkers preferred not to approach this circular, as a compass, and deep as an artesian well, lake without an absolute necessity. Water here was clean, no doubt, the air was also clean, radioactive tailings were not observed nearby, and the view around the lake was generally fabulous. Nevertheless, the stalkers did not like this place.
High dense pine forest surrounded the lake without a gap, even in those places where a clearance for the power line had been cut. The same one, one of whose pylons still survives in the vicinity of Cherevac, and near the other women waited for Lunev and his companions while they fought bandits in the searing forest. The pines around Krinka looked calibrated, growing almost equidistant one from the other and strictly three metres from the water's edge.
But most unusual was the bank. It was covered by thick, silky and absolutely alive (despite February) grass, which looked just as alive not only in the air, but also under water. The grass carpet started under the pines and went into the water to an unknown depth. At any rate, as far as the transparency of the water allowed, one could see the same grass on the bottom as on the shore. Grey clouds and drizzling rain hanging over the lake spoiled the fairytale picture a little, but on the other hand, the tale could have been about the grey wolf.
"Probably even him," Andrei thought to himself. - No one spreads rumors for nothing. Stalkers say the Krinka isn't a good pool, so there must be a reason.
Lunev glanced with Brazhnikov. The Major was not very happy about being forced to stop at the shore either. He didn't look at the forest but at the lake.
- It looks... Spooky," Scout said. - I heard there's waterbenders out here. Old boy, you heard that?
- Naw.
- Oh, man, you got to be kidding me. Don't you go to bars or listen to the news? Watermen, big ones, like newts, only about two meters long. They see you from underwater, float up and, like, show you their reflections. You know, like a doppelganger staring at you out of the water. You, of course, are shocked and staring at yourself in the water.
- Watermen grab you by the nose and drag you to the bottom, - Brazhnikov finished. - Sneeze. You'll get fairy tales like that in the market, a bundle for a ruble.
- Not at all, not... Nonsense, - Tatiana protested without stopping washing. - I've seen Andrei once... Well, we have seen these water-men once. In Pripyat.
- They couldn't have got here, - Andrei said reluctantly. - It's a long way from Pripyat. Not even close to the Ooze. And no brooks flowing in or out. If there's waterfowl here, it's our own. Or maybe it's just a story.
- Old one, - Olga called, - to hell with them, the watermen. I'm exhausted, give me five minutes... for personal hygiene.
- You've washed your face, what else? - Scout cut in.
- Did someone ask you? - Olga looked expressively at the stalker and shifted her gaze to Lunev again. - Dirt under her clothes... Rubbing everywhere. We have skin... Not like your kirzas.
The old man hesitated for a moment, but looked sideways at the nod from Brazhnikov and made a positive decision.
- Scout, go to the woods and keep an eye on the rear," he ordered. - Brazhnikov, check the route. I'll stay... as head of the bathhouse.
- Will you at least turn your back? - half-affirmatively asked Olga.
- No.
- What do you mean no? - Olga wondered. - Why not?!
- No means no, I will look at you and at water at the same time. - With a nod Andrei pointed at Tatiana. - Tanya just told me why.
- You saw watermen in Pripyat, not here!
- This conversation is over. If you wish to wash up, go ahead, no, let's move on.
- I wish, - Tatiana interfered in their quarrel. - Andriy is right.
- Well, yes, it is easier for you! - Olga glanced frowned Tatiana and then at Lunev. - And you're a pervert after all, Old.
- Why 'all the same'? - Tatiana wondered.
- And ask him one night, he will tell you.
Tatiana looked questioningly at Lunev, but he did not even move an eyebrow. As if Olga did not say anything. Such a reaction Tatyana seemed to be satisfied. She took off her shoes, took off her overalls, body armor, and pulled off the top of her overalls. Dirt after bombardment in the field near Cherevach and plastun exercises in the burning forest really got into the most secret folds of her clothes. Tatiana cautiously walked across the soft grass and fearlessly stepped into the cold water. She stood for a few seconds, getting used to it, then pulled off her T-shirt, bent down and began to splash.
- Was it cold? - Olga asked.
- I like a contrast shower. - Tatiana smiled forcefully. - I set the regulator to forty-five degrees, and then to four degrees at intervals of ten seconds, and so on for five minutes. It's even warmer in here, ten degrees.
- Does she really have a shower with an automatic thermostat? - Olga turned to Andrew and asked in surprise. - Scientists live very cheaply.
- Wash, - shortly answered Andrew.
- You could have said simply - "tolerate", - softly, clearly addressing the remark to Lunev, Olga grumbled, - otherwise... "I love contrasts. Fife!
The old man could see quite clearly that Olga was simply embarrassed and so she tried to talk some sense into herself.
Finally Olga took off her off-load, began unbuttoning her waistcoat... She unbuckled her body armour and suddenly, against her will, flew away from the water's edge as if she had been sharply yanked towards the forest on a rope. Andrei acted as the rope, and the winch as well. Grabbing the girl by the waist strap, he jerked her back and to the side, pulling her away from the danger zone, and away from the line of fire as well.
There was no real reason to open fire, but there was already cause for serious concern. Andrew stepped ankle deep into the water, called out to Tatiana and held out his hand to her. He kept his eyes on the centre of the lake. No, Andrew did not see dark silhouettes under the surface of the water or other signs of approaching creatures. He was not at all sure that Tatiana was threatened by any creatures. Perhaps it was the abnormal nature of the lake itself, but the danger was clear, that was undeniable.
In the middle of the lake, contrary to all the laws of physics, the water was slowly rising in a huge dome. If it were not a lake, but a swamp full of slimy mud, the formation of a giant bubble on the surface would be explainable. But the water certainly couldn't have risen in this way, unless... Lunev looked around anxiously... Unless a gravitational anomaly was trying to manifest itself in the centre of the lake.
Tatiana hurriedly pulled on a wet T-shirt, overalls, and only then strayed to the shore. Lost seconds cost dearly for both her and Andrei. Bloated in the middle of the lake suddenly exploded, and the high fountain shot up into the gray sky. The jet of water whipped at the low clouds, but what was more astonishing was not its height, but its diameter. The water column was at least three metres in cross-section. To understand the unimaginable mass of water that rose to the height of almost a hundred metres was possible only when the whole ten or so tank-cars of clear and cold liquid opened like a crystal umbrella and plunged back into the lake.
The terrible thundering sound made my ears prickle and the icy wind nearly knocked me off my feet. What the moving air could not do, however, the water did. Raised by fountain five meter wave in a flash reached the shore, and washed away easily, like two weightless pine needles, Andrei and Tatiana into the lake. Olga, who had managed to get away into the woods, was also hit by the water, but they were tears. The wave pelted the girl only up to her waist and did not even manage to knock her down.
Andrew has not seen how Olga, but assumed that she is now much more comfortable than floundering in the icy water of the couple, and therefore focused solely on finding and saving Tatiana. For some reason the companion was carried much closer to the centre, and now she was floundering on the side of a new wave, not so high, but still dangerous. The wave carried Tatiana straight into the pine trees, which temporarily became a parapet for the lake. What ends with the meeting with the trees after sliding with acceleration, Lunev remembered well. The episode with the bandit hitting the "Springboard" was quite fresh in his mind.
Andrei tried to rush across, but the wave was both faster and stronger than the man. The old man was also already being carried back, and therefore, to be able to catch Tatiana, he had to swim against the movement of the water. Not directly, at an angle, but still against it. There was no chance of success. Still, Lunev swam.
He desperately paddled until he was struck by a tree, so that Andrew briefly blacked out. The slight knockdown, however, did not prevent him from wrapping his arms and legs around the pine and locking his grip firmly. The next wave that came back was quite childish, two meters high, and brought Andrei to his senses. He shook his head, blinked and tried to find a glance at Tatiana.
At first he did not see anyone. Heart immediately clutched, but a second later Andrew found that Tatyana is still afloat, although again quite far from the shore. And she, too, was probably "lucky" to be firmly attached to the pine "parapet". The girl did not panic, struggled and did not sink, but her movements were not well-coordinated. In such a state it was not long before she lost her bearings. The lake is small, but, by all means, to the shore, where Lunev stood, is much closer than to the opposite, to which confused Tatiana could go. It was especially important to consider that the swim was taking place in icy water, and even a little extra distance could prove fatal.
Lunev's fears were confirmed just at the moment when he rushed back into the water. Tatiana began to rake to the opposite shore. A little more, and Andrei would not have to swim to the rescue, and directly to the other side and there to meet a companion - a prospect Lunev took rather cool - but then Major Brazhnikov has intervened in the development of the situation. He rushed out of the forest, instantly assessed the situation and rushed to intercept him. Lunev was relieved. From the position Brazhnikov to Tatiana was twice closer, and the Major had more strength than Andrew, so the chances of salvation increased significantly.
Andrew stopped, turned over on his back and swam back. A new wave came to his aid, quite light, it did not stop him, but only slightly braked Brazhnikov, but tired Lunev enough to get to shore.
Old man for a moment froze, stretched out on the grass in a starfish pose, then somehow got up, looked for Tatiana with the Major and ... again threw himself into the water.
Towards Andrei again ran low waves, but this time it was not an anomaly in the middle of the lake, and the very creatures, the appearance of which Old feared from the beginning. Two large monsters whirled around the swimmers, foaming the water with the strokes of their long flattened tails. It was difficult to see them in detail from a distance, but Lunev immediately noticed that the creatures had no paws, and the large flat head with a wide mouth and round, unblinking eyes most resembled a snake. In general the mutants looked like gigantic vipers, the only difference being their flat tails, which served the purpose of monofilaments. Later it became apparent that there were other differences as well. When Andrew swam closer he saw that snakes were covered with large scales, more reminiscent of fish than snakes, and had a different colour. There were no zigzags along the body, but chains of almost regular rhombuses of purple and dirty yellow. But it became clear that these creatures resembled vipers only from a distance when one of them opened its mouth. Its front teeth, which normally have channels of venomous glands inside, were not much longer than the others. A cluster of fifteen to twenty centimeter-long teeth stretched across its mouth from above and below.
Andrei had absolutely no idea what he could do once he got close to the creatures, but he stubbornly swam, trying to make as much noise as possible. Brazhnikov behaved roughly the same way. Neither of them had any serious weapons with them; both had left their submachine guns on the beach, but the Major managed to pull out his pistol. Looking at him, Andrey pulled out his Makarov as well. These clappers could hardly pierce the monsters' scales, but they could certainly distract them. And, as a matter of fact, that was what was needed now.
Lunev stopped, "sat down", using water polo swimming technique, and holding the gun with both hands, so as not to interfere with a large shiver of cold, took aim at the monster looming over Tatiana.
The Makarov might not be the most powerful or the best in terms of accuracy of the gun, but to wait for it to fail, even a delay, after just a swim in clean water was unrealistic. In terms of reliability this weapon has always been in second place after the Kalashnikov, even in comparison with the world's best prototypes. The gun did not let me down now either. Within seconds Andrey unloaded the magazine and hit the target at least three times. The bullets did no harm to the monster, but served as sufficient irritant to make the giant snake hiss discontentedly and turn sharply in the direction of Lunev.
Andrei changed position and, dropping his gun, swam backwards on his back. Competing with the water snake in speed was a sure loser, but the Old One was not used to giving up. When the monster was already two meters away, Andrew again "sat down" in the water and drew two favorite Finnish knives from his sheath. These blades, one new-made, the other real, with a rich history (on the blade still engraved "NKVD" and the serial number), ripped open the bellies of more than a dozen mutants and may well have done what bullets failed to do.
The giant creeper raised its flat head above the surface of the water and opened its ghastly maw again. The snake sharply stuck out its forked tongue, which almost touched the face of its would-be victim. Andrei estimated the distance and prepared to strike the snake looming over him precisely in the vertical pupil. The odds of such a venture succeeding were one in a thousand, but Lunev had faith in himself and his luck. There was nothing else for him but to hope and to believe.
- Down! - A sudden rang out from the shore.
Andrew, about to jump out of the water up to his waist to strike, abruptly relaxed his legs and plunged to the back. Dozens of bullets lodged in its mouth, chipping its teeth and shooting fountains of blood mixed with slime and flesh. The monster's head jerked back sharply, its body convulsed at about a foot and a half, and the creature slumped on its back and began a rapid plunge. Another shot from the shore snapped on the scales of the grayish-yellow belly, but these bullets did not frighten the snake. It continued to dive, exposing its belly above the water. Andrei seemed to see a huge wheel spinning in the depths a few metres away, part of its tyre protruding above the surface of the water. Finally the snake spectacularly slapped the water with its flat tail, and this blow almost blew Andrew's head off. Good thing he'd shaken off the stupor caused by the mesmerizing sight of the giant creeper diving and made a couple of strokes back to shore.
Just as the creature disappeared into the depths, shots rang out again from the shore. Andrew turned sharply and saw that now the cover was firing at the snake that had attacked Brazhnikov. The distance was twice as great, and as reckless as the first creep, this thing did not expose vulnerability to bullets, so the chances of the Major was much less. Brazhnikov's pistol was more powerful, the Viper was a popular pistol in the special forces, but in the unfolding confrontation the "snake" in Brazhnikov's hands was clearly inferior to the natural snake. The huge monster stood still for a second, waiting for all the bullets to hit its scaly snout, then it opened its mouth and with an elusive quick movement rushed at the major.
Andrei even thought he could hear the crunch of breaking bones, but he couldn't swear to it Old. All sounds were drowned out by a desperate cry of Tatiana, floundering ten meters from the site of the battle. Lunev put his knives in place, gathered his last strength and swam again to the centre of the lake, but then to the left there was heard a loud splash, and a new shout from Olga behind:
- Old, get back! Scout will help!
Andrew stretched his neck and made sure that Olga was right. Scout swam much faster. He soon reached Tatiana, competently, like a real lifeguard, grabbed her from behind and pulled her to the shore. Lunev turned his gaze to where seconds earlier the Major had been fighting. Bubbles burst on the surface of the water and slowly spread a red stain. What it meant was clear as day.
Andrei gritted his teeth and swam towards the shore.
Olga helped him out on the slippery grass, her own strength was not enough. Almost at the same time Scout and Tatiana crawled ashore. Without a word, without even exchanging gestures, the two couples, barely alive from the cold and overexertion, waddled into the forest and met on a tiny clearing about twenty meters from the lake.
The old man collapsed and lay there for a long ten minutes. In that time Scout somehow managed to wring out his clothes, wipe the gun and take the place of the sentry, while Olga went to the shore and collected weapons and equipment. Tatiana sat beside Andrei the whole time. He could not see her, but he could hear and feel her.
- And you say... there's no such thing as watermen, and snakes... Water snakes don't exist here, - Scout said after catching his breath, not looking at Tatyana, but obviously addressed to her. - Sure they are. I've never seen such teeth in my life.
Tatiana did not answer, because she could not. She was shivering and her jaw was cramped. The lady sat with her knees pressed to her chest, and barely heard a howl from the horror she had endured. Olga brought her equipment and tried to help Tatiana get dressed, but so far it was unreal. Tatiana could not unhook her arms, it was beyond her moral strength.
Andrew, on the contrary, finally found the strength to sit up. He was also terribly cold, he barely moved his lips, but still managed to answer:
- In Pripyat... Waterfowl looked like newts, but here...
- Vipers, I tell you. - Scout sighed sadly. - Nessie fucking... ...ate a man like that! I wish they'd choke on it, the buggers! I wish the whole Zone would choke on it!
- Let us be silent. - Andrei ran his palm across his face as if to wipe away the residue of water.
- I can't keep quiet! Tell me, Old Man, why is it so unfair? Why are you and I still alive, and why is the major gone? Why are we better than him?!
- Scout! - Andrei seemed to raise his tone with the last of his strength. - This is the Zone! You want to get snotty, go home and watch soap operas. The Major knew that every minute here could be his last! And that every action in the Zone has only two kinds of consequences - you survive or you die. He knew that too! Don't you think I feel sorry for him? He and I have been in so much trouble, you wouldn't dream of a hangover! But now unnecessary reflection and torment will only demoralize us! I'm sure Brazhnikov would have said exactly the same thing in my place. So I beg you, as a man, to shut up!
Scout looked sullenly at Lunev and shook his head reproachfully but - wonder of wonders! - didn't say a word in reply. To prevent him from changing his mind and starting his correct but totally irrelevant reasoning again in the current situation, Olga intervened in the conversation. Unlike Scout, she spoke briefly and to the point:
- Geyser... - said Olga muffled, sitting down next to Tatiana. - Geysers had certainly never been seen in the Zone before.
- It is not a geyser - the water is cold, - Old objected. - And anyway... Water doesn't rise in such a column under normal circumstances. Like it was pushed up by a plunger. Or with something else.
- Telekinesis, you mean?
- Most likely. And the bastard who pulled that stunt is still out there somewhere.
- Then we'd better get out of here! - Scout got worried again. - If he can get five hundred tons of water out of the water and out of the water, he can't throw pines over us at all.
- No, he's gone," Olga protested to both companions at once. - I don't feel anything. Probably such experiments take a lot of strength.
- All the more reason to tear up the claws," Scout declared. - He's not rested yet. Might be able to break away.
- He'll find it anyway. - Olga glanced sympathetically at Tatiana. - And right now we're not ready to go. At least let us dry off and rest for a while. It is good for you, you have swam back and forth, stretched your legs, and the whole business. And how much they've been struggling!
- You'd think you were overworked! - Scout started to get worked up again. - What do you mean, he'll find me anyway? Are you going to tell him where to find us?
- He was boring me. - Olga grimaced wearily. - Paranoid lunatic.
- No, you answer it!
- Scout! - Sternly said Andrew. - The subject is closed once and for all, got it? If you ever mention traitors in my group again, I'll have your head!
- I can get to the bottom of this even with my head unscrewed," Scout muttered. - Olga didn't answer anyway! You may unscrew it. Here, please!
He leaned over to Andrew and craned his neck.
- Sit down and rest, - Old ordered. - The enemy will find us anyway, because we cannot turn off the path and get lost in the forest. How hard is it to understand? If he doesn't find us on the trail, he'll wait at the entrance to the hidden sector. As for the informer, it could be someone at the base.
- There's probably no one left at the base! The Major, in good memory, told me it was a meat grinder there, pure Stalingrad.
- That's another matter. And anyway, we have no choice. Whether strangers follow us or our own betray us doesn't really matter. We'll go on and get there, whatever it takes.
- Just don't make fanatics out of us, okay?! - Scout rose with determination. - I ain't volunteering to go into hell!
- Perhaps not into the frying pan, but into the mouths of some," Olga grinned. - Or what are you saying? We have gone through water, we have gone through copper pipes, we have gone through a bombardment with tractor parts too, now we have fire, right?
- Am I prophesying? - Scout stared at Olga in surprise. - What do you mean? I just said so. It was a figure of speech.
- Well, yes, and you talked about snakes in Cherevach, and before that you were afraid that soon we would be swept under a copper curtain. You don't think so? What was that, prophecy or were you giving the enemy clues?
Scout was literally rendered speechless by Olga's accusations. He stared at the maiden in indignation and opened his mouth silently.
- What we have fought for, we have got," said Old with a sneer. - One for one. "That's it, we're through with the halt. And we're done throwing mud at each other, too. Rise and march. Olga, help Tatiana. Scout's in the back. We'll head northwest, through the eastern outskirts of Korogod and on to Chistogalovka. Follow me!</text>

    <text>...The rutted stone pier in the ruined Pripyat on the bank of the cooling pond was slippery and seemed uncomfortable to Engineer for the first time in years. And the rain pockmarked surface of the water could not make him feel any more at peace today. And the gloomy autumn sky, which oozed perpetual rain, was annoying. The only thing he didn't care about was the dank dampness that soaked his clothes and chilled his body to the bone. A black fire was raging in his soul, on which fierce hatred was simmering in a cast-iron cauldron of depression. Such a powerful inner heating could easily cope with any dankness. 
The engineer hated everyone and everything, but above all the people who had been responsible for the collapse of such a carefully thought-out and well-organized operation. The engineer cared little for material losses. Sitting on a pile of gold and gems it was silly to think about such things. The scattering of artefacts, with which the hidden sector had always been rich, could be considered not even a pile, but a mountain of jewels. Still, neither the Engineer and company were helped to succeed by limitless funding, nor by the enthusiasm of psionics and those who wished to equal them. The intensive way of expanding the Zone was no longer a viable option. And all at the mercy of a bunch of humans who decided they were the coolest in the Zone! 
The engineer stared at the man lying at his feet. This frightened scientist accidentally survived the flooding of the main laboratory, where people, bribed with money and impressive promises psionics, tried in vain to turn themselves into a semblance of their masters. 
Yes, things were not going brilliantly in the laboratory. What the Flash had done in a flash, the scientists had "grafted" long and hard. But some things did work out. A year or two more experiments and a new species of humans, latent mutant telepaths, could have been widely distributed throughout the world. What good would it do the Engineer and the Psionics? Direct. They could gain access to all the secrets of the world, all the technical and military innovations, they would clamp the outside world in their fist! And then... it's simple. All the potential, all the knowledge accumulated by the world would be thrown into solving the main problem - the expansion of the Zone. 
"Now that problem would be solved by the military! Only for them it has the opposite sign! They are the ones who want to prevent the expansion of the Zone. They are trying with all their might to take complete control of it. In fact, that is why they reacted quickly and clearly to the emergence of a new anomaly. They threw a clever group into the middle of the Zone, helped them get to the Zov generator, and destroyed it along with our helpers from among the would-be mutant humans. Bloody humans!" 
The engineer squatted down, took the trembling scientist by the chin and pulled him slightly towards him. Large drops of cold sweat on his forehead, trembling lips and bulging eyes did not give the man any solidity. Only yesterday the Engineer had regarded this man as one of the best minds among all the workers of the clandestine laboratory network. One could say he respected him as much as one could respect a man. But now he saw the trembling creature as nothing more than a piece of fallow meat. 
The Engineer, however, was in no hurry to kill it. Dinner could wait, business first. He had not yet learned the main thing: who had located Kazakevich and his assistants? Who had sent the scouts and special forces here? And in the first place, who had guessed that Zov was an artificial anomaly? Apart from pure curiosity the Engineer was driven by another consideration. If this unknown adversary was so clever, sooner or later he might realize the main thing - that someone more powerful was behind the conspirators' backs. This was not to the engineer's advantage. Especially now that he had to virtually start from scratch. 
- Carry on," the Engineer hissed with a little anger, and let go of the man's chin. 
- That mercenary pulled a machine gun on me! - whimpered the scientist. - I've known the guy a long time, he wouldn't shoot without thinking! I had to give him the computer that controlled the Call generator. And then he left... to get his friends out of their cages and we rushed to the tunnel, which was rapidly filling with water, but the trolley was still working. We got out at the very last second. The moment the trolley returned to the shore laboratory, the tunnel was flooded to the brim. 
- People have the computer," the Engineer summed up. - ISI HQ. That mercenary managed to get out in time, too. Clever bastard. Who was he? Who was his employer? 
- His nickname is The Old One, and who he was working for... I don't know! Nobody knows the employers. Contracts are made through intermediaries... 
- Think," the Engineer interrupted his lamentation. - The computer went to the military. Through whom? 
- I don't know... but actually... counter-intelligence! Through the counter-intelligence! They're the ones who ran the operation, they brought in mercenaries, it happens, it's their way of insurance! General Ostapenko - that's who you want! He's the head of ISI counter-intelligence, he conducts all such operations. A very cunning man, very cunning! 
- Shut up. - The engineer made a barely perceptible pass with his hand and the scientist cut short his fiery speech in half a word. 
The shrill intonations in the scientist's voice irritated the psionic's delicate hearing, and the smell of fear - sour sweat and urine - reeking off the man was disgusting. The engineer rose from his squatting position and stepped aside. To the very edge of the jetty. 
He stood at the edge of the mossy parapet and stared out over the dark water. Whenever the Engineer had some free time, he was sure to come to this jetty. He felt at ease and thought best here. Besides, it was safe here. In the event of superior enemy forces appearing, the Engineer always had a place to hide. First of all - under water. Somewhere deep down there was an emergency exit from the underwater laboratory, now completely submerged, and a little to the left was a bottom hole in which a giant catfish, which until recently had served the purpose of a cerberus, had been living. 
"Until recently. It's hardly the "latter time". But today nothing pleases or reassures me at all! And what is worse, I have no desire to plan anything even for one day in advance. It is as if this hour is really the last! Damned people! They'll pay me dearly for everything! First of all for daring to take away so many nerve cells from me!" 
In the depths of the pond a huge black shadow moved. The engineer fixed his gaze on the shadow and mentally whipped the fish on its back. The catfish jerked from the pulse that pierced its body, like a strong electric shock, but did not sink to the bottom of the saving pit. It was as if it had admitted its guilt and meekly accepted its punishment. The creature even wiggled its fins, like a man who guiltily spread his hands. The reaction of the catfish suited the Engineer, and he limited himself to a single blow. The more so as this blow helped him to discharge the accumulated tension and finally curb the anger hampering his mind. 
Three rather simple but logical conclusions emerged instantly in his "cooled" mind. First: nothing is lost until people have no idea who really opposes them. The second: if it was not possible to make people allies, then the Zone itself, or something not so inert but able to do the same job, should be called upon as allies. And the third: the key, the greatest asset of psionics, must not be discarded. The Engineer had not yet managed to make contact with it, but the owner of the artefact felt he was on the right track. 
"It's only just beginning, General Ostapenko," the Engineer thought, regaining his composure. - 'You will be surprised how deep the hole you have so recklessly jumped into is. A real chasm. And from it, as from any decent abyss, there will be no return for you." 
The engineer turned and met his gaze with Ghost's. The master had not yet articulated the thought, but the aide had already grasped the meaning and followed the silent order without hesitation. He stalked over to the trembling man, snapped the man's neck in one swift movement, and threw his body into the pond. To the delight of the giant catfish. The three female psionics who made up the Engineer's personal guard took the fish meal as a rather wasteful gesture, but quickly got over their emotions and banished from their thoughts regret for the disrupted dinner. They were hungry, but fear of the Engineer was stronger than hunger. After all, there were quite a few other people roaming the Zone whose meat was not so imbued with the sour taste of fear... .</text>

    <text>...All of this happened quite recently. Just the end of October. But now it seemed like a century ago - so many events between that autumn evening and today. Events different; both good and bad, but, the main thing, not fatal. Balancing on a fine line between victories and defeats, the Engineer had finally reached the final point and now had a good chance to put a thick end to the matter. And thus erase from memory all unpleasant memories of the collapse of the first major psionic operation. And the second as well.
The heavy memories seemed to spur the Engineer's creative thought, and it suddenly dawned on him. He realized what he had to do to crack the peculiar limiter that prevented the Key from using all the energy stored in it to create the maximum number of transitions.
For the first time in years, something resembling emotion stirred in the Engineer's soul. The feeling was contradictory, partly reminiscent of a long forgotten feeling of joy, but another part of it resembled fear. Joy that the stubborn artifact was beginning to reveal its greatest secret, and fear that it might be only an illusion.
The engineer forced himself to tear his gaze away from the crystal and raised his eyes to the ceiling. The glass of light was slowly turning into a flask. A milky white glow, hitherto not understood above the walls, was reluctantly creeping up the vault to the gaping hole in its centre.
It was certainly a victory! The engineer had forced the "Key" to open access to a new energy level. First of all, this meant that the Engineer would be able to create at least two dozen more passages to the outside world.
"And then double that number of exit points as well! And later on, make the passageways not close during the Ejection, so that they are always open. And then the long-awaited moment of truth will come!"
Inwardly the Engineer rejoiced. Yes, jubilant, now he knew exactly what was going on in his lost soul. Fear and unabashed joy were gone, giving way to victorious euphoria.
"Enough critters for all the crossings! - The engineer grinned. - 'And there will be enough of them. The anomalous radiation in the Outbreak, the counterpart of the Thirteenth Standard, would begin to reshape the outer world, and with it, its inhabitants. The notorious Outbursts, those pathetic imitations of the Flashes, will become what they are supposed to be, their energy spreading far across the world and forming new Zones around the transition points. Where new creatures and their masters will be born. Millions and millions of new mutants and psionics. This time it will work out just like that!"
- See how clever you are," a mental voice from the outside world intervened in the Engineer's thoughts. - You should have taken the job yourself in the first place, not been lazy.
- I have come to this result by trial and error," thought the Engineer, holding back his frustration so as not to spoil the solemnity of the moment. - When I came up with the Zov's idea, it seemed to me to be a good one.
- Yeah, but you picked misfits to be your sidekicks. It happens. Though to bet twice on people is not an accidental mistake, but a logical folly.
- You're wrong. The plan to use the Black Angel anomaly to expand the Zone was also correct. Humans played an auxiliary role here. If it wasn't for them, the psionics would have done the job. Not so fast, but...
- You make a mockery of people by haste," the irony was evident in the thoughts of his interlocutor. - So you have.
- It's going to be different now.
- Really? Do you know where I am now? Halfway to Korogod. Stomping through the woods like a maidan. At a walking pace. Do you know why? Because of all the great and terrible psionics you sent out to meet the group, only one survived. How many were there originally? Five?
- Your group is a minor liability, nothing more. The fate of the world is decided here, in my castle. Neither the Old One nor his companions will change that.
- Well, well. - There was a hint of mistrust in his voice. - I would advise you to think of something else and leave it to someone with a little more experience. Or, better still, do it yourself. You're doing so well, aren't you?
- You impertinent beast! - The Engineer blazed up. - I'll decide what I do! If you ever give me that stupid advice again, I'll have the Psiots destroy you and your band!
- Oh, I'm afraid. Let your psionics practice on the cats first. Your beasts can't handle the Old One's band. They can't handle it.
- By the way, on the count of four or two," the Wraith, appearing as unexpectedly as ever, broke into the tense exchange of words. - We're losing, I'll give you that, but not by a landslide.
- Four for sure, but you're probably exaggerating about two. - There was still a touch of irony in the mental voice from the Big Earth. - The Major was gone, a fact, as he liked to put it. As for the Mechanic... it's an open question.
- Why do you think so? - Ghost asked, mimicking his interlocutor's ironic intonation. - Because you are the Mechanic?
- Tell you everything! Military secret!
- Then you're one of the women.
- Wow, how did you guess?! - A mental voice filled with outright amusement. - What if I'm a stalker or the Old One himself?
- No, a stalker is too weak to be a latent psionic, and Old... he reeks of death. He's human, and he's dangerous. Someone who has been blessed by the Zone, even a tiny fraction of it, can't be that dangerous. So who are you?
- The engineer will tell you. If he wants to.
- Not yet," said the Engineer.
- Is it?" the spy's mental voice oozed sarcasm. - Or perhaps it is that you're not even sure who I am, after six months of knowing me.
- I know who you are. - The engineer tried to think calmly again. - You are an impertinent, underdeveloped being who tries to place himself among us.
- Creature? - The spy seemed satisfied. - You don't even know what gender I am, Engineer. Well, what's your famous telepathy worth?
- Shut up, bitch! - The Engineer mentally squeezed his interlocutor.
The spy flinched a little, but stopped talking. The boasted telepathy was worth something. As a means of breaking the will of unruly humans, mutants, and halflings alike.
- Ghost, you'll handle this group personally. - The engineer shifted his attention back to his assistant. - Take as many psionics with you as you need, and go.
- Four brothers and three sisters remained in the castle. The others have gone to the outside world to command invasion teams.
- Then take the rest of the brothers. What you said about the Old One is true. I feel the same way, which means it's true. One psionic can be wrong, two can't. If we can both sense trouble and pinpoint its source, then it's not fiction, it's a signal from the foggy future.
- It's all mystical, isn't it? - The spy was not thinking so boldly, but he gave himself a suspicious chuckle. - I'll risk giving you one more piece of advice, if you don't mind my saying so. Put your psychic powers away for a while and take up automatic weapons. The results will be a hundred times better. I'm telling you.
- We'll keep that in mind. Were you able to find out what the walkers are carrying into the sector?
- Only personal firearms.
- You guarantee that? No bombs?
- Only if one of them is a bomb. But I don't think people have learned how to dilute blood with TNT.
- 'The word 'bomb' has a figurative meaning too,' Ghost remarked. - Someone in the group might have dangerous knowledge or a skill.
- Then it's the Old One," the Engineer concluded confidently. - Focus your main attention on this mercenary, Ghost. And please, both of you: don't distract me anytime soon with any trivialities. Very soon everything will be ready for the main attack. I need to concentrate.
The engineer severed the mental link with the spy, but left his mind open to Ghost. The aide knew that the master would do just that. And it wasn't the ability of experienced psionics to see into a foggy future. It was simply that Ghost had not had time to report to his master on the status of other matters, and the latter, in turn, clearly wanted to give some more instruction regarding the Old One's group.
- You first," the Engineer ordered.
- The borderlands are occupied by us in ten sectors. Two bases are resisting so far. We'll destroy one in no more than two hours. The last one is more difficult.
- Ä-3?
- Yes. The military have barricaded themselves in the depots and are successfully repelling all our attacks.
- HQ hasn't ordered them to retreat yet?
- Our brothers behind enemy lines are doing their best to instill fear and awe of our army in the ISI headquarters, but they can't put concrete thoughts in their heads. As long as the D-3 base resists, the HQ will still have doubts. And hope. The brothers fear that the men may throw heavy equipment into the fight. If that happens, a breakthrough to D-3 could be the beginning of a successful enemy counteroffensive.
- That won't happen," the Engineer confidently countered. - I am well aware of the psychology of the people. They're demoralized and would rather bomb the base than risk a breach. It's easier and safer for them. And they can justify their weakness by not wanting to take casualties. Base garrison versus breakout group - the arithmetic will be on HQ's side.
- A bombardment could cause noticeable damage to our army in sector D-3.
- There will be no bombardment. When the men mature to such a decision, they will have new combat objectives. More important than clearing the Borderlands of our creatures.
- Did you manage to shake the crystal?
- Yes, Phantom, I did. In a few hours, it'll be ready to open another dozen passages, and then...
- I see.
- That's good. Off you go.
- You wanted to clarify the mission, Ghost reminded me. - I sensed that.
- Oh, yes. I wanted to make it easy for you. Don't try to figure out which walker is our agent. Kill them all. It's for the best.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a6_doc_8">
    <text>Abandoned since the first disaster, the settlement of Korogod was notorious for being impossible to approach unnoticed. Almost all of the abandoned settlements of the Zone were drowned in dense scrub or young growth; some, such as Zapolya or Ilovnitsa, were gone, while Korogod still stood, surrounded by bogs, and was perfectly visible from any direction. Compared to the views of thirty years ago, the landscape around the village had still changed: the forest took over about one third of the area from the vast fields, and the large islands in the swamps turned into impassable areas of jungle, so overgrown with bushes, but in general everything remained the same as before. It was easy to stay on course for the ruins of the village, even when the destination was still a few kilometres away.
When the group finally emerged from the forest and took a short break at the edge of the forest, Olga was the most attentive to study the route ahead. She walked to the right, stood at the edge of the swamp, studied the view of the distant ruins through her telescope, and returned to her friends. She reported her observations to no one.
No one asked her. Andrew sat against a tree, covered his eyes, while Scout and Tatiana lay there, and all they were interested in was rest and a can of energy drink.
After the start by the lake Krinka Andrey has allowed only two short rests and categorically forbade using any stimulating drinks or pills. The four exhausted men contented themselves with water and biscuits from the dry food ration. No amount of begging or moaning had any effect on Lunev. He only relieved his comrades by promising that they would be allowed to open one of the three cans of energy drink each of them had saved for the next break.
All the walkers were well aware that Lunev was not a man on the rampage but a rational man. No, it was not because Andrei foresaw many difficulties ahead and reserved the energy drink for emergencies, no, it was not because of fantasies, but because he calculated the exact duration of the route. Two to six hours' walk remained before he reached his destination, depending on the situation. The Energizer, which had earned a fortune in the formulation of some Frontier scientists, was a very special beverage, not at all like its counterparts on the mainland. It took fifteen minutes to produce its effects, but it took four hours before it reached its peak, lasting about four hours before slowly fading. So it only made sense to "cheer up", as Scout urged, by going to the outskirts of Korogod. Which was now, in fact, what had happened.
Lunev was the first to open the can and drained it in a gulp. No further commands were required. The others followed the leader's example, and drained their cans in one go as well.
- When you reach the target, drink the second, - said Andrew. - The effect will be stronger and it will last. Should be enough for almost twenty-four hours. If we are not out of the woods by that time, we drink the third, we have half a day left.
- And the consequences? - Tatiana asked apprehensively.
- The usual. - Andrew shrugged. - When let go - weakness, nervous exhaustion and irresistible sleepiness. A day of sound sleep, and all will pass.
- A nightmare of some sort. - Tatiana cautiously looked at the jar with a painted tiger.
- Stimulants do not come without consequences. No, if you do not abuse it and limit yourself to one jar per day, then there will not be any side effects. But it doesn't always work that way in a raid.
- It never works that way," Scout pointed out. - And sometimes you have to suck up ten cans a day. Some of them get locked up in the hospital for a week afterwards. In the psychiatric ward.
- But that's... is not normal! That's no way to treat your health!
- Health, ma'am, is the condition of a living organism," Scout said with a pout. - Dead is unhealthy by definition. So a doctor once told me when I was in the nuthouse after a week's raid. Sometimes it's better to be a little sick than not be sick at all. Along with your life. Don't you agree?
- Better not to go on such long raids!
- Well, then it's better not to go to the Zone at all, and work as an accountant in Konotop.
- Why there? - holding back laughter, Olga suddenly asked.
- And why not there? - Merry sparks gleamed in Scout's eyes. - It is a nice small town. Silence, peace, museums, NATO military base, you can exchange your chewing gum for milk there.
- Have you been drinking energy drink or something stronger? - Shaking off the drowsiness Andrew asked. - Wake up, I see?
- Five more minutes, Commander!" Scout pretended to massage his legs. - Stilts have overheated, let them cool down. It's not like anyone's catching up with us. Olya, am I right?
- I can't feel anybody.
- There you go!
- I don't mind, rest. - Lunev got up and walked leisurely down to the swamp.
The path led straight through the swamp, but there was still room for maneuvering. Andrew immediately spotted a path that ran to the right of the resting place and led to the nearest bushy island. Lunev well remembered that the swamp on the other side of the island was bumpy, but without surprises, and only about two hundred meters wide. From there began a gentle ascent up to the outskirts of the village. In fact only the first section, up to the island, was dangerous.
- One would have to go more to the left. - Olga stood beside me. - Over there. Do you see a hut at the edge of woods in a distance?
- A barn? The old chemical warehouse?
- Yes, chemical fertilizer. There's a dry path right across from it.
- But there's no path to the sector.
- Maybe there isn't, maybe there is. - Olga shrugged her shoulders. - The mechanic said the trail widens again here. Up to a mile and a half. It's just about eight hundred metres to the warehouse. If we're in the middle of the trail now, it's OK.
- We can get through here, too. - Andrew pointed to the high camel's humps to the right of the position. - Here along them. The main thing is not to slip and not to break legs.
- Leeches are all right, there are ... ...the sea. And they rush in like piranhas, in a jiffy, in a flock. They'll rip you off, you'll get tired of pulling you off.
- And you, too. - Andrew grinned. - Making up stories.
- Seriously, I've seen it myself.
- You see how they sucked all the blood out of a man," Andrew sneered, encouraging his companion.
- Not all of it, but a lot. But it was not the cause of his death. Three hours later he cut himself when he opened the canned meat stew in the rest, hands trembled from weakness, the rest of blood drained out of him. Those leeches injected some shit into him, the blood did not stop. We bandaged, tourniqueted, cauterized... all to no avail. Turns out his blood wasn't staying in his vessels, it was leaking slowly. Into his stomach, into his lungs...
- Yeah, not funny. - Andrew snorted. - All the more reason not to fall from bumps. We need poles to cut down for support. Take Scout, do it.
- All right.
Olga has returned to the rest place, but Andrew has not been alone for a long time. Tatiana approached him. She was silent for a while, then sighed and pressed Andrew to the shoulder.
- So far I am more trouble than good, right?
- Bye. - Lunev put his arm around her shoulders.
- Thank you, you've cheered me up," she said quietly.
- And you wanted me to start talking to you? - Andrew stepped back a little, and tried to look into Tatiana's eyes.
- No." She didn't want to meet Lunev's gaze.
- Do you blame yourself for Brazhnikov's death?
- What do you think? - Tatiana sighed again.
- I think so, and I think in vain.
- Are you saying it's fate?
- No. This is war. Local, secret, but as difficult and cruel as any other.
- War," repeated Tatiana thoughtfully. - For what? For what ideals or territories? For this swamp and other sectors of the Zone? Who needs them?
- War is always not for something, but with a purpose. In ninety percent of cases it's for the purpose of enrichment. Anything that happens in the Zone is no exception. People here are fighting for control of territories where artifacts are produced. So they make money.
- And not people? There are telepaths, controllers, as you call them, trying to stop us. What's their interest?
- Same thing.
- I don't think they're after the artifact trade for a living. I think their motives are close to those of any resistance. The Zone is their home, and they're trying to protect it from outsiders, from us.
- It's not that simple. - Andrei shook his head. - I'm sure eight out of ten mutants have no motivation at all. They're driven by instinct and a sense of hunger. But the remaining twenty percent, those who have retained the remnants of reason, aren't just resisting our invasion of the Zone. They are preparing to strike back. What's happening now at the base is convincing proof of that. I do not know if this is the beginning of a counterattack or a reconnaissance battle, but the inhabitants of the Zone do not intend to limit themselves to expelling the aliens from their home. They wish to go beyond its borders and expand their habitat.
- And you think the headquarters of this army is in Sector Thirteen?
- I don't know. But the general probably thinks so. And so far all we have is confirmation that he's right, no denial. We've got the base attacked from the Thirteenth, and there's no doubt that some reasonable but still mutants are trying to slow us down, and there's a good deal of backstory to go on with this one. When you look at it from today's perspective, everything fits together without significant gaps. The facts fit together into a clear picture. Only the last big piece is missing. Ostapenko thinks we'll find it in Sector Thirteen. The closer we get, the more I agree with the general.
- Let's assume everything is as you say, but... - Tatiana moved away a little: - There are only four of us, and even then... you could say three! If the sector headquarters and the main base of these... intelligent mutants, what can we do?
- We'll see there. - Andrew shrugged his shoulders. - One thing I know for sure: Ostapenko never sends people on absolutely hopeless tasks. At least one chance in a thousand we have, I'm sure. What that chance is, what the general is counting on, I don't know. But that old gobshite certainly knows something that'll help us get the job done.
- What? Know what exactly?
- I don't know, I told you!
- And if you don't?
- Then we won't make it.
- Dizzy with such inconsistency! - Tatiana was indignant. - Why did not Ostapenko immediately told at least you what the ultimate purpose of the mission!
- Most likely, so that no one can not ferret it out of me. - Andrei smiled. - Or to be able to extract it from my memory through telepathy. Think of yourself three months ago. Before you were sent to the Zone, Ostapenko didn't drug you heavily with chemicals just to ease the stress of being a rookie. He was afraid telepaths would find out about your spy mission.
- Never once did I think of the spy mission," Tatiana admitted. - Until I returned to the base, I thought I was doing the right thing, of my own free will.
- That's what Ostapenko wanted. So that you are in the role as much as possible and do not even in dreams about your close ties with the counterintelligence. In my case, the chemistry is unnecessary. Ostapenko is confident that I'll draw the right conclusions without knowing the purpose of our mission.
- Everything is clear. - Tatiana finally tore her thoughtful gaze away from the swamp and turned it to the ruins of the village in the distance. - Another dead village in hell. I don't understand how you can love these creepy places. Why are you all drawn like a magnet to the Zone?
- I'll tell you when we get back," Andre promised. - If you have not found the answer yourself by then.
Behind them there was laughter and stomping. Lunev turned around and looked at the approaching couple in surprise. It was surprising, but there seemed to be no trace of the animosity between Scout and Olga. What was the reason for such a sudden change of mood, especially for Olga, Old could not even imagine. It wasn't the energy drink that had had that effect on her.
"Maybe she's just relaxed? The controllers are far away, no other creatures in sight either... Or maybe that's not it. The fewer of us there are, the more she realises how petty her crankiness and nagging is. Anything could be."
Cut down by Scout staff exuded fragrance of pine tar, which, together with the invigorating effect of energy and the emerging improvement of morale in the group uplifted the mood and instilled confidence even to a thawed Tatiana. When they managed to pass without problems the dangerous part where in the mud between slippery bumps countless number of leeches swarmed, their mood rose to the level bordering with euphoria. For the first time in the whole raid none of the walkers were hurt, not even stumbled on the slippery springy bumps, and no one argued with anyone, which was, in fact, even more important.
Once on the island, the walkers dropped their sticks and took up their knives. The shrubbery was not tall, just above his waist, but thick and tenacious. As Scout put it, it was easier to roll through than to walk through.
- It's only at the edge of the island, but it gets thinner from there," Olga promised. - And there isn't any in the centre of the island. The ground is saturated with some rubbish; nothing grows there.
- Rubbish? - Scout asked uneasily. - Abnormal?
- I don't know, white stuff. Like salt had come out. The background didn't seem to be much. No word from the detectors, either.
- White stuff? - Scout's got a sly grin on his face. - All right, let's smell it.
He pretended to sprinkle something on his wrist and sniff it in. The pantomime was amusing, except that Scout had somehow blurred the end of the sketch. The artistic mask suddenly slipped from his face, giving way to an expression of concern. He lowered his hand and sniffed the air, then sniffed his hand again and then the air again.
- Something... I don't understand. - Scout looked around restlessly. - From somewhere... smells...
He sniffed again.
- Smell of what? - Olga sniffed the air, too. - Nothing... ...except marshy.
- Doesn't anyone smell it? - Scout took a step toward Olga and sniffed again.
- Hey, take it easy. - She grinned. - Not dogs to sniff!
- I mean it. - Scout glanced at Lunev. - Old man, can't you smell it, too? I can smell the smoke.
- What smoke?
- What, what kind of... smoke. - Stalker turned his head again. - Nothing seemed to be burning.
- Maybe you're being brainwashed again? - Olga suggested. - Take off the glove, clench Joker in your fist, it will help.
- No one was sitting on my brains! - Scout pointed to the eastern extremity of the island. The bushes are burning!
- There, too," said Tatiana, pointing west. - And there.
She waved to the south.
- Where what is burning? - Olga turned her head in surprise. - What are you talking about?
- Can't you see? - Scout wondered.
- No.
- Oh, well, that's because you're six feet tall in stilettos. Let me lift you up.
- Yeah, you're running! He'd do anything to feel it.
- It's really burning, - said Tatiana.
- Well, I believe it, - said Olga indulgently.
- We must move. - Andrey pushed both companions forward. - Before the fire blows to the north too.
- The wind is coming from that direction, it must not," Scout protested. - No, who's the fire maker? We're non-smokers, we didn't throw cigarettes, we didn't get sparks in our eyes. Leeches didn't set it on fire, did they?
- Not leeches. - He glanced around, trying to spot a sign of anyone in the same spot where the walkers had rested recently, but saw no one.
Continuing northwards, Lunev narrowly missed Olga, who suddenly stood upright.
- What is it?
- We must not go that way! - She whispered, pointing to the ruins of Korogod.
- More inspectors?
- Yes, lots of them.
- Who's with them?
- No one. They lead no one now, but that's even worse. They're not distracted by controlling the wards. All they think about is us. Soon we'll feel it.
- And when the arses go up in flames, we'll feel it even sooner! - Scout said nervously. - Look, it's on fire! The fire's going faster than a train!
- But the wind... - Andrzej glanced anxiously around. - From the other ... side.
- I don't know where the wind's coming from, but we'd better press on. - Scout pulled on his mask.
- The smoke is... acrid," Tatiana said, coughing. - And thick.
Andrew and Olga glanced at each other. According to Lunev, there was no particularly acrid smoke around. The shrubbery in general burned as if it were well dried brushwood, almost without smoke. In the meantime, it, like the rest of the Zone, was being sprayed from the grey skies for hours on end every day. Theoretically the bush should indeed be smoking thickly and acridly.
- Well, well. - Olga squinted her eyes and stepped resolutely towards the approaching wall of fire. - On fire, you say?
- Can't you see it?
- That's the point. - Olga grinned. - Where is it burning? Over there?
She pointed in a southerly direction.
- Yes, over there.
- How badly is it burning?
- It's full blaze.
- Interesting. - Olga moved towards the southern tip of the island, treading on the group's old footprints.
- Put your mask on, though," said Andrei.
- I'm not burning, you know.
- The salamander was found. Put on a mask, I told you!
- All right, all right. - Olga reluctantly put on the filter mask and gloves.
Ten metres in front of the wall of fire she stopped and turned around.
- Here?
- Yes." Andrei nodded.
Olga spread her arms, as if enjoying the wave of heat coming in front of the shaft of fire, and froze. The sight was not for the faint of heart. Realizing what will happen to Olga, Tatiana silently groaned and clutched at Lunev's sleeve.
- You're crazy! Both of you! Call her off immediately!
- Calmly. - Andrei patted his companion on the arm. - She'll manage.
- Handle what?! Put out the fire with her mind?! What is this nonsense?!
- Mind you, I only said she can do it.
- Olya! Scout's nerves are fraying too. - That's enough! No more feats! Old man, what's she up to?
- Don't you understand either? - Andrei grinned. - Then just watch and wonder.
The wall of fire engulfed Olga and moved on, straight at the walkers. Tatiana shrieked once more and backed away. Scout remained beside Andrew, but he got nervous as before, all ready to run away, as soon as his commander gives the signal. Lunev stood calmly, even relaxed, as if he was not looking at the formidable elements, but only at its image on a large screen.
The shaft of fire advanced a few meters more, but suddenly slowed down and froze in place, not reaching Andrew and Scout quite a bit. Interestingly enough, when the fire stopped, the heat coming from it had miraculously disappeared. The smoke, not even a hint of the smell of burning, was out of the question. They had vanished even earlier when Olga entered the wall of fire.
- Shit," Scout muttered, pulling down his mask. - A phoney?
- Illusion. - Andrei walked over to the blazing wall and ran his hand into the scorcher.
In five seconds he took two steps back, simultaneously bringing Olga out of the flames.
- Bow, curtsy," he asked Scout, clapping his hands a few times. - The Soviet circus can do wonders. I only do not understand, is it a mass hallucination or something else?
- How can you stand there, the heat is unbearable! - Tatiana came closer to the trio and said. - And there is nothing to breathe.
She shielded herself from the wall of fire with her palm and pressed a mask to her face.
- There's your answer," Olga said. - Each of us is handled by a different controller. Tatiana got the most talented one... as always.
She did not look at Lunev, but Andrei noticed that it cost her some effort. Still, some tinge of jealousy in her attitude to Andrei and Tatiana was present. It partly flattered her ego, but on the whole it was more of a negative thing. The group was just beginning to forget the petty quarrels. And in general now was not the time to quarrel.
- And how to... hypnotize her?
- She couldn't. - Olga shrugged.
- What are you talking about, what hypnosis? - Tatiana hid behind Andrei's back. - Are we just going to stand here until we turn into a kebab?
- Let's go. - Andrei pointed to the northeast. - Are the controllers there?
- They're in Korogod. - Olga shook her head to the north. - But they won't be able to flank us, don't hope so. They'll smell you.
- And you? They are still thinking for three, they do not touch you.
- So they don't know how many of us are left. As many as they smell, as many as they press. But there's an open spot next, they'll see me.
- We're going that way anyway. Let them think they're scared.
- Hear that? - Scout was suddenly on the alert.
There was a thin, lingering hiss to the walkers' ears.
- Yes, that's a bummer. - Andrei spread his arms, pushing his comrades back.
A loud splash could be heard from the east side of the island, followed by a thud and numerous slams of mud that rose to the sky and then fell back into the mire.
- A short shot," Scout commented. - A shot from an arsenal. So they're not the only ones meeting us, then? Some riflemen with them.
- They are the shooters," Olga protested firmly. - We must go straight to the north. It's harder to hit an approaching target with a swoop.
- But it's fun to aim straight ahead," Scout protested. - Not forward!
- Have you got a better suggestion? - Asked Andrew. - All forward. Trot along!
The second grenade exploded on the island, but still far away from the group. The grenadiers, invisible gunners, whoever they were, controllers or their next unwitting helpers, were lousy. A third explosion, rumbling on the west bank of the island, only confirmed this hunch. The group passed the centre of the island - indeed, bare as a bald patch of salt-like white crystals - at top speed and crashed like a sea wave into a new swath of scrub. At the northern end of the island the bushes were much taller, nearly as tall, but not as dense, so there was little change in speed. When there was a glimmer of light ahead, Andrei ordered a halt and went to reconnoiter.
As chance would have it, another round from the underbarrel grenade launcher went off at the exact moment when Lunev looked out of the thicket. Andrei easily spotted the point from which the shot was fired. The grenade launcher was hiding in the ruins on the very outskirts of Korogod, it turns out, three hundred meters from Andrei's position. The distance is ideal for operating from the shaft with the optics. Just let him stick his head out. The only thing was that the enemy did not seem to want to stick his head out.
The bushes on the right rustled, and Olga stood beside Andrew.
- Can you see them? - she asked in a whisper.
- No, do you?
- Three go down to the left, two to the right come in, all with submachine guns. Really you do not see?
- I can't see, I told you!
- Just what we need is chicken blindness. - Olga took aim and fired three shots in a row.
The return fire was indirect, but one of the short bursts cut the tops of the bushes fairly close to the walkers' position. Andrei backed up and beckoned Olga behind him.
- Did you get it? - When they got out of the thicket, he asked.
- No." Olga shook her head. - Or the bullets don't take them. Left flank seemed to twitch, but did not fall. He kept walking, he didn't even limp.
- It's a familiar situation, don't you think? If they're carrying particularly powerful artifacts from Sector Thirteen, bullets won't hurt them.
- Neither can we.
- But we're all hypnotic. Except you. So you're alone against five armed telepaths. - Andriy tried to imitate Olga's intonation: "Do you need it?
- Against six. - Olga nodded, pointing south. - That creature who gave us a bloody shower on the lake will soon join those five, I feel her.
- All the more reason. Anyway, no more amateurism, you understand?
- What if you all get pinched again?
- That's when you're on your game.
- I am.
- I'm good for now.
- That's what you think. Listen to me for once, Old Man, at least out of pure curiosity.
- Well, spit it out," said Andrew grudgingly.
- They will not let us off this island.
- I wonder how they'll manage it? - Lunev grinned indulgently. - You can't control the whole perimeter with six of us.
- They don't need to control the perimeter. They control us. You mean you. You think you let go after you figured out the trick with the fire? It didn't. The controllers are still sitting on your brain, and I'm sure they're not just sitting on your brain, they're messing with your mind. You're relatively sane for now, but pretty soon you're going to swim and lose control. Joker or amulet won't help.
- But why would you think that?!
- Because I have a feeling those three are coming for you. And the two coming in from the east are controlling Scout and Tatiana. The controllers are well aware that you're the most dangerous, and they act for sure. When the sixth one joins them, so do I.
- You're immune to hypnosis.
- I have a high tolerance for it. But I do, just like everyone else. Remember when we wandered Pripyat in the fall, and I got it too. Or today in the labyrinth. The mechanic confessed that the first time he wandered through it was twenty-four hours. I got out in half an hour. But I still got in trouble! So when Six tells his mates there's four of us, they'll redistribute their powers and the trap will close.
- So what do you suggest? - Lunev was willing to admit that Olga was right, though he could not accept her arguments as convincing. It was difficult to believe his own inadequacy.
- I must leave before I fall under the same pressure as you.
- And who's going to get us off the island when... when the controllers get all gangly?
- If I succeed, they won't.
- If! - Andrzej grinned wryly. - And if they don't? What are you planning?
- I won't say!
- Are you superstitious? Afraid of being jinxed?
- I'm afraid the inspectors will "talk" to you.
- Have you learned how to intrigue from Ostapenko?
- Think what you like. Shall I go?
- God be with you, - Andrei gave up. - How long do we have to wait?
- You will wait," Olga answered evasively. - In five minutes you won't want to leave the island for any money. I'll bet.
- That's for Scout, I'm not a betting man.
That's where we parted ways. And that lack of interest in betting saves money, Andrew was convinced not after five minutes, but after only a minute. Steps and rustling of naked bushes behind Olga have not yet subsided, and Lunev has already felt how another's will begins to press upon his brain. To reassure himself Andrei clutched the Joker in his fist and took the trusty amulet in his teeth, but nothing helped. Just as Olga had predicted. How many controllers piled up at once - three or four - Andrew was no longer interested. The telepaths easily penetrated both protective shells and suppressed the human will. How to get out from under this pressure, Lunev had no idea. Soon he stopped thinking about it. All he wanted to do was to sit down in a lotus pose in the middle of the salt patch in the centre of the island and meditate. Or just go to sleep. That was not a bad suggestion either, from the point of view of Andrew's new masters of body and mind.
Somewhere in the depths of consciousness the vestiges of a conscious attitude to himself and to what was going on around him were still flickering, but all that these particles of self-consciousness were capable of was abstract observation and making conclusions. They did not contribute to any decisions.
Andrew saw Scout and Tatiana approach him, as both dropped their weapons, collapsed on their knees and then sat down next to his commander, but he could not say anything to them. Nor would they have heard. They were in exactly the same stupor as Lunev.
Some time passed - maybe a minute, maybe an hour, Andrei lost his sense of time - and the bushes rattled to his right. It was unreal to turn his head, he had no strength left, besides, he did not want to. But with his sideways vision Lunev still saw four figures in dimensionless gray robes. He did not see any weapons in their hands, but he could not see the hands themselves. The hooded men probably had machine guns after all, but they were hiding their weapons under their clothes.
"It's not the artifacts," the adequate part of Lunev's personality, trapped in the basement of consciousness, thought. - These guys are artifact walkers themselves. But it's not mystical reasons why bullets bounce off them. It's the hoodies. I saw them in the lab where they made my amulet. But they were experimental prototypes back then. There's another proof that Ostapenko's right. Kazakevich's labs, the black angels, the Thirteenth Sector are all links in the same chain."
The bushes rattled to the left as well, but who and in what formation approached the shoulder from the eastern direction, Andrew had no hope at all to see. It remained to be guided by the sound. It sounded like two men approaching from there. If they were controllers, they were now a full complement. One thing was odd: all six stopped about twenty meters away from the trio of walkers, as if afraid to move on.
"What are they waiting for? We could be taken with our bare hands. Or just shoot us, like bottles at a firing range. Not even a drunken miss. What are they thinking about? Are they talking? Fearing a catch?"
Andrei never knew what the controllers were afraid of or what they were conferring about. In a second the situation had drastically changed, and then Lunev was no longer thinking, reflexes and ingrained combat skills kicked in.
The thought of the bottles on the range suddenly materialized, only a little differently than Andrew had imagined. Behind the western foursome of enemies came the sound of shattered glass. A pungent smell of paraffin and some kind of chemicals reached Lunev's sense of smell, and then a wave of heat washed over Andrei. This time the hot wave was not imaginary, but real. A second later two more broken vials slammed down, and almost immediately Lunev was relieved. It wasn't easy to recover from such mental overload, but Andrei didn't. He relied entirely on his reflexes.
Three of the four "balakhona" blazed blue, but apparently did not yet understand how dangerous it is. The fourth was in no hurry to extinguish his comrades. He turned his back to Andrei and, trying to figure out where the partisan arsonist was hiding, stared at the bushes from which Molotov cocktails had flown. Lunev, if he were the inspector, would have done something simpler - he would have mowed down some vegetation with a long burst and then watched how it was. But the telepath was accustomed to rely primarily on his abnormal instincts and held his gun trunk to the ground. That's why he didn't react when the fourth bottle flew straight into his face. The flask flew very fast - the thrower was clearly trained for such throws - precisely to the forehead - and from where the controller believed it could not come from. That was why he had no time to dodge or crouch.
The sound of broken glass this time was lost in the wild roar of the creature. He threw off his hood and slapped at his cheeks, trying to quench the blaze, but it only made matters worse. Following face lit up his hands, flammable liquid flowed into the sleeves and sinus, in a moment the flames burst already from under the cut of his cloak and Controller blazed pioneer fire from head to toe. Or rather the other way round.
The attention of the "hot four" has finally switched to themselves - controllers finally realized what threatens them if no action is taken - and Lunev finally let go. Andrei left the creatures alone with their worries and resolutely moved toward the remaining eastern pair of foes. An attempt by one of the controllers to attack telepathically was ignored by Andrew. One telepath was easily dealt with by his defences. Lunev even had the thought that the Joker and the amulet were trying to rehabilitate themselves - the psi stab went as if on the tangent, not even causing dizziness. As if to demonstrate his resistance to such attacks, Andrei threw up his 'shaft' and treated the 'hooded man' to a short burst of fire. The bullets quite expectedly didn't pierce the controller's overalls, but discouraged and forced the enemy to take a few steps back. The second telepath didn't wait for the man to treat him to a couple of lead blows, and ducked sharply into the bushes. Andrew took aim at the first man again, but he followed his partner's lead and cleared the eastern escape route. Andrew backed up, intending to go back and literally by the scruff of the neck to get his comrades out of the danger zone, but it was no longer necessary. Tatiana and Scout were already on their feet and waddled to the commander, every second glancing at the controllers rolling on the ground and setting fire to the bushes.
- Run, run, do not slow down! - Andrew waved a hand. - Follow me and keep up!
The brushwood, set alight by the accelerant mixture, rattled, almost drowning out the roars and shrieks of the telepaths and at the same time Lunev's commands. And the smoke was indeed thick and pungent, a real, unconventional one. The wind blew the smoke quickly across the island, cutting the walkers off from the restless enemy. The group pulled on their masks and moved across the bumps in the direction of the gentle slope in front of the village.
- And Olga? - Tatiana shouted. - Where Olga?
- She will catch up! - Andrew slowed down, let his friend go ahead and pushed her slightly. - Scout, a wider step!
- In my head... I'm buzzing in the head," the stalker admitted. - Cold as a freezer. What have they done to us?
- Nothing much, but we'll be walking a long time at this rate. - Andrew glanced at the ruins of Korogod. - And look to the left. Telepaths had submachine guns without a trigger. Somebody remained in their reserve.
- Do you think those four were burned? - After a decent moment's pause, Scout asked again.
- I sure hope so. I don't know what that little pyromaniac of ours put in those bottles, but it's all sticky and slimy and unquenchable, almost napalm. If you survive the frying, you'll be in for a long, hard recovery.
- If you are human, but what if you are a mutant?
- So what? The point is the same, these mutants aren't aliens. No, if we've got any stalkers on our tail, it's the two that weren't hit by Molotov cocktails. And the other one. The one left in the rubble. Somehow I think he's the most dangerous of all.
- Why?
- Because he didn't go out on a limb. Smart move. And a smart enemy is twice as dangerous. Even if, as a grenade launcher, he's a total zero.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a6_doc_9">
    <text>After the "batmen" landing, predicted by Bibik, had been destroyed, a special gleam appeared in the eyes of the defenders of the citadel. It was especially important to the soldiers that the stalkers got involved. The forgotten slogan of Soviet times "The people and the army are united" was not popular in the Zone, even on the contrary, in a less complicated situation would have sounded absurd. But now the stalkers were forced to put their grievances against the military in the past, while the latter, in turn, had to forget about their grievances against the civilians. A considerable role in rallying the consolidated garrison played an authority such people as Bibik, who passed a difficult path from the private stalker, and then a military guide, to the commander of the special forces, but he remains the authority for the former civilian comrades. However, what united them was the understanding that they were human. Simple, not endowed with any magical talents, but tenacious, skillful, and most importantly - born first on the earth, which, for some inexplicable reason, has become an anomalous zone. So, if the defenders of D-3 heard reasoning Tatiana Sergeevna that mutants protect their home, they would probably object: "Originally this house is ours, neither the Zone, nor its devils we did not invite into it.
It was because of the particular enthusiasm that General Ostapenko's order to counterattack the creatures (it was worded that way: "Counterattack the creatures") was received by all with a bang. The short preparation for the operation was led by Bibik, and therefore everything was thoroughly thought over and calculated to the minute. The colonel was very thorough. Bibik made a thorough reconnaissance of the area and found out that the direction to the west was controlled by mutants rather poorly, and if he covered the group with massive fire from the north and a screen of armored vehicles from the south, he could create a narrow corridor, which could lead at least the part of civilians who could not take part in military operations. Thankfully there were no children among them, only a dozen teenagers who had joined the D-3 tent camp under the irresistible urge for adventure, but there were plenty of women and elderly people, mostly scientists from the laboratory sector.
When all the mortar and artillery firepower of the citadel hit the northern direction, the controllers commanding the beast withdrew some of their troops outside the base, but still did not leave the situation unattended. Once again an enormous cloud of creatures was in the air, ready to swoop down on any part of the base, blocking the path of the advance party. A column of armored vehicles moved from the southern gate and diverted the attention of the Batman for a moment, but the crafty creatures, realizing that there was no point in crashing against the armor, moved only slightly to the south and continued circling at a respectable height, still controlling the entire base area.
When the west and northwest gates opened, the monsters instantly realized that the main group, not the distraction, was about to leave. The whole pack instantly turned around and headed for a descent over the western sector. Neither the heavy fire nor the rapid advance of the column helped the men achieve what they had planned. The vanguard of the breakout group, consisting of stalkers and a third of Special Forces fighters, was instantly cut off from the citadel, surrounded and almost completely destroyed. People fought desperately, to the last cartridge, and when they ran out of ammunition - as long as there was enough power, worked with knives, spades and improvised means, but the mutants crushed the mass. Only five of the hundred managed to get out of the cauldron alive: two stalkers and three commandos. Thanks to the skilful command of Lieutenant Pashkov guys cut their way back to the citadel and literally three seconds before inevitable death were in the dead zone near the walls of the warehouse complex. A barrage of fire threw back the mutants who had overtaken the five and allowed Pashkov and his comrades to return unhindered to where they started a quarter of an hour ago.
- Not much farther... - Pashkov said, breathing heavily. - If we reached Andreevka, they could hardly stop us.
- That's for sure. - Bibik patted the lieutenant on a shoulder encouragingly. - You well, worked competently. Rest for half an hour - and to me, I will be in a staff, under the fifth warehouse.
- Yes, yes. - Pashkov exhaled noisily, took off his helmet and wiped sweat from his forehead. - Don't you have a smoke, Colonel?
- I don't smoke and neither should you. - Bibik paused.
- Here. - One of the stalkers handed the lieutenant a pack.
- Yeah, thanks. - Pashkov pulled out a cigarette, but he couldn't light it - he broke it. His fingers visibly trembled. - Eh, we would reach Andreevka ...
Stalker lit a new cigarette himself and gave it to Pashkov. Lieutenant took a deep puff, then again, and only then took the cigarette from the stalker. The trembling seemed to have subsided.
- Though... to hell with the advice. - Bibik again patted Pashkov on the shoulder and went to the headquarters.
Ostapenko met the colonel with a heavy stare and a short nod towards a sodden chair. He already knew all about the results of the breakthrough attempt, except without particularly impressive details.
- A hundred just passed," the general gritted through gritted teeth. - A waste of time.
- Guilty! - Beebeek threw up his hands.
- What have you got to do with it? - Ostapenko grimaced. - Sit down!
- Well, it's not your fault either," Bibik tried to soften the situation.
- Whether it is or not is a question of the sixteenth. I am in charge here, so I am responsible for everything and for all. So listen to my command, colonel. No more breakthroughs. Duck and cover until substantial reinforcements arrive. Or a wrecker. I think if we hold out till morning, we'll have a chance. Kiev promises to send a big box. If we squeeze, we can all fit.
- Maybe we can, but it's not a matter of passenger space, it's a matter of traffic. You'd need tanks to get through here. I've seen the creatures rampaging from the tower. Along the Teterev, they're building a real roadblock. Wild boars and pseudo-giants are knocking down trees, tearing down houses and turning vehicles upside down. BATs and BMPs may not go through.
- Tanks will too. They're already out.
- And the air?
- It's being dealt with right now.
- Being dealt with? - The colonel grinned. - Usually it means "we'll consider your question in a week, and in two weeks call, we'll give you the answer".
- Mr. General! - A fighter looked out of the adjoining room. - Kiev on the phone!
He handed Ostapenko a satellite phone. General glanced expressively at Bibik: "you see, I told you, it is being solved". Bibik answered with a similar look full of hidden meaning: "you first answer the call and listen to what you are told and then we will discuss who was right and how to get out of it now".
Judging by the expression of general's face, which changed ten times in half a minute - from calm and attentive to indignant and even angry - Bibik was much closer to the earth than Ostapenko, slightly soaring in illusory clouds. Throwing into the tube a couple of short "Understood" and one "Yes", the general knocked out the connection and literally threw the tube to the fighter. Good thing he was ready for something like that and caught the valuable device like a seasoned hockey goalie. After the successful "save" the fighter preferred to retire to his control room, as the next thing the general tried on was a vacant chair, by the way - an iron one.
Ostapenko did not throw the furniture around either. He managed to pull himself together quickly enough and used the chair for its intended purpose - he sat on it opposite Bibik.
- Let me guess," asked the colonel. - The Nats are afraid to bring the cars together in an armoured fist because they suspect us of collusion with Moscow and Minsk. Allegedly we have arranged the mess in the Zone, to roll up their base near Kiev with tanks, yes?
- I don't know who's afraid of what, but the staff thinks it's inexpedient to make a reenactment of the Kursk Bulge here. There will be boxes. Only not one strike force, but several smaller ones, and they'll stop at the outer periphery of the Borderland. In our sector - on the right bank of the Teterev. We are asked to break through, or infiltrate, as we prefer, towards Gornostaipol. Headquarters does not intend to go deeper into the Zone.
- So they're admitting to mutant takeover of the entire Frontier region?
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- You fat-ass cowards! God send a united HQ! They shouldn't be in charge of the Isolation Force, they shouldn't be in charge of the pioneer camp!
- You don't know the main thing yet, - said Ostapenko tiredly. - They are going to raise the attack aircraft and bomb the base.
- How come?! - Bibik was amazed.
- Into the dust. With a volumetric blast munitions.
- No, wait a minute, what about us?!
- You heard him: we've been asked to leave. All at once or in small groups. To Gornostaipol.
- But we won't even make it a hundred meters, all together or in small groups! Why didn't you tell us that we already had a sad experience of a breakthrough?!
- Do you think they would have listened to me? - The General waved his hand languidly. - Headquarters knows best, don't you know? You can see everything from Brussels... It's like the palm of your hand. They've got satellites, real-time pictures, resolution so you can see every tooth in every mouth. And the HQ is just trying to please the NATO guys. In short, Bibik, as one show business acquaintance used to say: "If you want success - promote yourself. Nobody will help us. Only ourselves and a higher power.
- There is still hope for the Old One...
- A slim one. In our situation it is better to rely on more concrete things.
- What things? - Bibic grinned nervously. - There are three concrete things in our situation, all with a minus sign. Trying to break through - death by beast's teeth, defence of base - blow us to hell with those devils, the third variant - to shoot oneself directly. I don't feel like relying on any of them.
- Do you have any other suggestions?
- Not yet. How much time do we have?
- Ten hours. At midnight, HQ will bring up the stormtroopers, and... in another half hour, this place will be a natural moonscape. You could make a movie.
- Yeah. - Bibik puzzledly scratched in the back of his head, sat for a minute in silence, looking at the spread map of the Zone, then took out from his pocket a satellite phone and stood up. - We have to call the Old One, to confess the purpose of the mission.
- Why? - Ostapenko shrugged his shoulders.
- What for? So that he could find his bearings quicker. And in general... to stimulate him.
- It will not help. And you won't contact him, I've tried several times. Zero.
- It's worth a shot. I can't think of anything clever to do anyway. But I'm not used to sitting around waiting for the end. I'd rather just make a stupid phone call.</text>

    <text>The forest to the north of Korogod was almost no different from the forest around Lake Krinka. It even had the same lakes, small and ungodly. One difference was that these lakes, together with significant portions of the forest, were constantly changing their location. Not by much, by two kilometres, but unpredictably. After each Ejection one had to explore the area anew as the path one had walked a week before could be blocked by a deep lake. There was no information about creatures inhabiting these migrating lakes, and there was talk of waterfowl, but no one could give a description. However, after what had happened on the Krinka, Andrew was not going to find out how true the rumors.
That's why, when Tatiana shakily announced that she was haunted by d?j? vu, Lunev without further ado led the group to the left and round the lake, looming in the gap between the trees, along a wide - as far as the invisible path allowed. Tatiana was right. Lake Kovteb situated (usually) north of Korogod resembled the Krinka. Well, maybe slightly larger in size than the first. In other respects... The same forest around, the same grass on the shore, even a young forest glade through which the power line had run once was in place, on the left side of the lake. Another matter was that Andrew had not expected to find this body of water on his way. Last month the lake was splashing much to the east, at the edge of the Kameneshchyna tract. But to wonder at the vagaries of the Zone Lunev had stopped six years ago, after his first raid. If the terrain is migratory, what else can you expect from it? An anomaly is an anomaly.
The trail ran exactly along the clearing, but the experience-wise Lunev did not fall for this trick number thirteen. It was much easier to walk through the old forest than to wade through the young trees. The group simply kept the clearing in sight, but moved west, and at a good pace. It soon became clear that it was not only easier but also safer to walk this way. Half a kilometre from the lake the glade was covered by thick grey strands of Burning Fluff. The hikers, having been carried away by the struggle with the jungle, might well have fallen into this, now familiar, but therefore even more frightening stuff. And, as Olga put it, "it" was definitely "not necessary" for the group.
The thought of Olga stirred the tide of association. Andrei turned to Scout and measured him with an attentive glance.
- What?" The Stalker examined himself as well. - I'm all right, what are you looking at?
- Not even burned? - He let a grin spread across his face.
- No, why? - Scout stared at his leader in bewilderment.
- Nothing. - Andrzej turned away.
- No, wait, you wanted to show me something, didn't you? - Scout looked indignant. - Oh, I see, you think I'm to blame for all your troubles, too, don't you? You see, it's all my fault, isn't it? First copper basin, then water, and now fire. Yes?
- I don't think anything, get off my back.
- You say "a", you say "b"! You think I give clues to my enemies?!
- Maybe you have a hidden gift of foresight. - Tatiana tried to diffuse the situation.
Her attempt only further annoyed Scout.
- And you think that all this is my fault?!
- No, I told you... the gift of foresight...
- I don't have a gift! I have no gift at all! I don't even have an ear for music! And anyway, why do you believe Olga for once and not me?! Do you think she's a sinless girl? She's killed so many people, I won't be able to beat her record until I retire! She was out there for half an hour before we got hit by the copper bowl! And the only thing she didn't do was get in the water. And she didn't give a damn about the fire!
- If it had not been for Olga, you would have eaten yourself, - said Andrew sharply. - At the will of the controllers.
- Ew. - Tatiana shuddered. - It happens?
- It happens here all kinds of things. Olga seriously helped us out on the island, so there's no need to sling mud at her.
- Scout said irritably, "Yes, of course we do! - Scout said irritably. - Scout said irritably, "Let's not talk dirty about me, will we? I ain't helped no one out yet. I've done nothing but slap a few bandits and dive into a lake of snakes. Tell me, Old Man, where did that inch of yours get the Molotov cocktails? And what makes you think she was the one who threw the bottles?
- She did," said Andrei with conviction. - She got the chemicals from the warehouse. To the south of Korogod there is a farmyard and a chemicals warehouse. You can find petrol there, and a thickener to make it out of. Olga is a trained chemist who can make combustible and explosive mixtures out of anything, even nail polish and icing sugar. You know that.
- That she's the famous Smoker? I know. I'm just not sure it was her anyway. You said someone was in the ruins, maybe he helped us out.
- Throwing grenades at us and then helping us out?
- No, he didn't! Remember, the grenades exploded where the controllers came out. Maybe he shot at them?
- A variant, - admitted Andrei. - But Olga threw bottles, I tell you for sure.
- Even if she did! That's no reason to accuse me of who knows what!
- Olga will catch up with us, right? - Tatiana hesitantly asked. - That's what she will tell herself.
- Good. - Lunev nodded. - Closed the subject.
- Where's the apology!
- Don't worry about it," Andrei brushed him off. - All, quiet, the slope begins, save your breath.
- So, are we close? - Scout asked.
- Yes. Now we only have to go up and down the hill. Two kilometres in a straight line. Three if you take the terrain into account.
- But we shall wait ... - Tatiana started.
- No! - Lunev interrupted her. - We will not wait for anyone! We ...
Suddenly voiced a satellite communicator in his pocket Andrew and he grabbed for the device, not ending his thought. In theory there could be no interference, but in practice Andrew could barely hear half of what his interlocutor on the other end of the line was trying to say. And it was something of a riddle, too. Most of the words did not make any sense and seemed to be said backwards. After listening to this gibberish for a minute, Andrew put on the speakerphone and gestured to his companions to join in the decoding.
- "Tidzb batsh?" - Scout repeated after the unknown caller in a whisper. - "Tichuvre sword tibmobzar?"
- "San eshorp mi otch yarevz oklots mogork," picked up Scout's baton from Tatiana.
Having repeated all this nonsense, she shook her head and grimaced.
- What kind of language is that? - Scout stared at Andrew. - Albanian?
He held up his hand, urging the stalker to be quiet. Andrew tried not to miss a word of the strange speech in the incomprehensible language. Communicator, however, hesitated for ten seconds only, then repeated twice (it seemed to Lunev as if questioningly): "Yanem shishils", was silent, it seems, forever.
- Pindyk "tib-mob-zaru," - shook his head like Tatyana, said Scout. - What kind of connection do you have? What operator? New standard?
- "There are so many beasts around, it's easier for them to bomb us than to help us out," Tatiana said suddenly. - And a little earlier... no, I can't repeat that.
- "The HQ is bzzing to break through," Andrei said with a nod. - 'That's right, we heard the speech backwards. And it's a shame I didn't realise it at the beginning. Because it was in the beginning, i.e. actually - in the end, Bibik expounded the most interesting thing.
- What?
- I don't remember.
- Shit!" Scout nodded at the communicator. - Maybe we should call him ourselves.
- The computer's dead. - Andrew poked into the machine buttons and handed it to Tatiana: - Sort it out?
- Like all. - Tatiana repeated her attempt to reanimate the communicator, but did not succeed either.
Scout also failed. Strange communication, albeit in "Albanian", resolutely did not want to establish. In the end the stalker returned the device to its rightful owner and shrugged.
- I do not know how to revive it. On the other hand, everything is clear. There's trouble at the base, and so much so that Beebick decided to call us. I don't know what he expects. That we'll come back and support the garrison with a dashing attack into the enemy rear? "So many beasts, it's easier to bomb," and we won't be defeated.
- 'No one is asking us to go back,' answered Andrei. - The Colonel asks us to hurry up.
- Wait," Tatiana suddenly became alarmed. - Distortion of his speech... why did it happen that way? I understand the Zone and everything else... but why was the link silent and silent and then suddenly alive, but... "turned inside out"?
- Because that hill is the very place where the ordinary world smoothly twists and becomes the hidden world of the Thirteenth Sector," Andrey suggested. - Do you have any other explanation?
- So the other side of the hill is already the Thirteenth?
- No, wait a minute," Scout interjected. - The mechanic said there's a clearing and a ring of mist. Like a gate or something. You go through it and you're in the sector. Or am I confused? Or is the mechanic lying?
- Right, the clearing and the fog and all that," Andre agreed. - Only I have a suspicion that this fog ring in the clearing won't be of any use to us yet.
- I don't understand.
- It's the same ring that's been appearing at the base. They've seen such rings in other places, too, and then some particularly well-fed mutants started running around in those places. You get the idea?
- No.
- Let me get this straight. Where the rings were found, new mutants also appeared, which means they were getting out through those "burrows" from the Thirteenth. But no one ever made it through those rings into the sector.
- From there blow, there... Nothing. - Scout hummed. - The nipple principle.
- Exactly. The mechanic wasn't lying. All you have to do to get out of the sector is step into the 'hole', but to get into it you have to walk long and hard down the path. So you can spot the place. We are standing where for ordinary walkers it's just a wooded hill, but for trail walkers it's the place where the moment of truth arrives.
- I'll make a notch. - Scout took out his knife and approached one of the pines.
- It will be interesting to come here just like that, in a normal space," said Tatiana. - Could find Scout's notch, don't you think?
- Scout! - Andrei turned sharply to the stalker. - Are you serious?! Stand down! It's a trail!
- So what? - Scout genuinely surprised. - What's the next step? We're getting there.
- Are you really stupid or are you kidding me?
- Well, all right, all right, what are you getting mad about? - Scout hid the knife. - I got it, I got it. No sign of him.
- One more stunt like that, and I'll decide you're a saboteur," said Andrei sternly. - With all the consequences. I am not Olga, I will not play interrogation. So you'd better think twice before you do anything.
- Well, I told you I understand!
- He understood, - he grumbled Andrew and turned back to Tatiana: - What did you ask?
- You have already answered. - From Tatiana's voice flew romantic overtones. - Here so far everything is the same as everywhere else. It is still a relatively normal world.
- It is a frontier territory. - Andrei nodded. - On the opposite slope the Thirteenth is already there. If you leave an idiotic notch there, only the controllers can detect it. And if they were here... better not to leave any traces at all!
He finished his sentence with an accent and looked sternly at Scout again.
- You don't have to shout at the whole forest either," grumbled Scout grudgingly. - Are we moving on, or what?
Suddenly he raised his hand sharply, silencing his stalker. What he suddenly felt was akin to a familiar sense of telepathic pressure, but Lunev was somehow ready to swear that the new controller does not try to break through psi-proofing and generally - does not intend to subjugate his will. It was as if he simply wished to make his presence known. Again - not a demonstration of power, just a warning: 'I'm coming.
"Or 'They're coming'," it suddenly dawned on Andrei. - Someone is trying to help us!"
The assumption was a bold one, and if Andrey had voiced it, it would surely have caused a violent reaction from Scout. But Lunev didn't voice it. He gestured for Scout to watch the area closely, while retreating with Tatyana deeper into the forest. Andrei himself remained in place.
Convinced that he had made the right conclusions, Andrew was only a minute later. Rather sparse woods on the hillside allowed seeing the approaching enemy in all its glory from afar. Probably realizing this as well as Lunev, the two controllers walked without even trying to hide behind the trees. Andrei scrutinized the enemies with his optics and took a couple of steps back. The group had a decent head start, and in theory, these creatures did not pose much of a threat. Even allowing for the fact that there were two of them.
And yet, taking two steps, Lunev stopped and again caught the figures controllers in his sights. Something was not right. The creatures could have walked much faster. They simply had to go much faster if they wanted to catch up with the walkers. But the foes were walking as if they were contemplating something, like meditating philosophers on a walk in the park. Why should they? There were two possibilities: either the controllers were trying to exert mental control over the group, or... over their next assistants.
Andrei looked around. The telepathic helpers could be hiding in an ambush, for example at the top of a hill or on the opposite slope, or they could move behind the group, only bypassing it from the flanks. In both cases, to disrupt the enemy's plans, they had to change course urgently or attack first. Or better yet, do both at the same time.
Scout had gone far enough away that it would have been too risky to call him out, and the field headset had died at the same time as the communicator. It remained to wait until the stalker bothered to look back, but there was no time for that.
Andrew again raised his weapon and tried to aim it at the controllers, but the cunning creatures seemed to sense the danger and hid behind the trees.
Once again a revelation came over Lunev. There was no ambush ahead. But the flanking maneuver of the auxiliaries of the enemy began long ago and just now completed it. The controllers were kept in sight until the last moment only to draw the attention of the "game" away from the real hunters.
Andrew raised his automatic rifle with the barrel up and concentrated on the signals from the other senses besides sight. A small as a fly, but equally intrusive and very unpleasant thought was buzzing in his brain. The new assistants of the enemy did not want to make their presence known. Not at all. Few specialists could work so covertly. Even the best members of the intelligence groups "Monolith" and "Dutya" were to a retired mercenary like bears: both heard and seen from a mile away. Lunev was rarely beaten in games of survival, even among his former comrades-in-arms. But that was exactly what was happening now.
"Well, let's see how you beat me. - Andrei plugged in his gut as well. - Rarely, but still, some have succeeded. A couple of times the Special Forces, and specifically Brazhnikov's men succeeded. It's a good thing they weren't hunting me at the time. And a couple of other times former brothers-in-arms almost succeeded. Mechanic, for example..."
Special Forces were ruled out today, Lunev was certain. That the controllers had managed to lure Mechanic, who had survived the shelling, was also difficult for Andrew to believe, but the creatures could easily lure the mercenary group that had passed by the Opachichi and send it along the trail. It was a bit of a stretch, for it would have been near to impossible for them to run from Korhogod to Opacichi and return with reinforcements while the group was wandering in the direction of the hill. But it was if to run. But if they flew...
"They could have flown. Otherwise what the hell would they need Batmen for? As an assault aircraft, they are clearly unsuitable, but as a transport - still there and then. Tatiana was taken by four people, so the controllers could also be taken to the point. And a mercenary's squad can do a simple march back in the opposite direction. Especially under cover of controllers. No anomalies in the way, no beasts. Run along and enjoy it. While we were dragging from Korogod to Chistogalovka, they arrived. But where is he now, this unit? It's obviously close, but where?"
The sensation that a man suddenly appeared behind him, almost right up close, was unexpected and somewhat disconcerting. Not even Brazhnikov's boys had snuck up on Lunev like that. Although, truth be told, that time Andrey found himself in the hands of the Special Forces, causing them almost no trouble either. They caught him, as they say, warmly.
Andrew suppressed desire to deal with his adversary and stood still, waiting for the banquet to continue. Nerves were strained, but rich experience told him that a half second pause was a good sign. Behind him stood one of his own. An alien would have tried to cut his throat long ago.
- They're on their left," the man behind them whispered, leaning close to his ear. - A full group. Leader is Zonder, you must remember him, the bully from Lyakh's brigade.
Andrew slowly turned to the left and prepared to fire his submachine gun.
- Don't go to the right, - the man behind you whispered again. - The path here is acting like the last bastard. It may easily throw you off, or take you away in a circle for twenty-four hours, as in that labyrinth. You can only go straight through the summit. Anyway, you've got to go with the psychotronic unit. It works, but it won't get through the Joker.
- What about you? - And you?" asked Andrew, barely audibly too.
- I've got your back. You won't get away from Zonder just like that, you know. He's stubborn enough as it is, and now there are controllers on the brain.
Lunev nodded.
- Was it you, who chased the inspectors away with grenades in the swamp?
- ß. I got hit on the head by an iron bar in the field, had to lie down and then dash straight to Korogod. Thought I'd catch up with you sooner, but you were gone.
- We slowed down at the Krinka. Unfortunate.
- Brazhnikov?
- Yeah.
- Pity. Anyway, no time to talk, Old Man, go.
- Good luck, Mechanic.
Kruger disappeared as silently as he appeared. Andrew turned around, but managed to see only the shadow of his comrade, flashed to the left between the trees. In the back of his mind, Lunev was even pleased that the Mechanic had finally reached such a decent professional level. Once upon a time, Andrei himself had taught the new recruit Max Krueger the basics of the craft. The apprentice hadn't yet surpassed his teacher, but he was already on par with him. For someone it might have been a blow to his self-esteem, a cause for jealousy, but for Lunev such a turn of events has caused only positive emotions. A worthy pupil, even if he is not too malleable and does not always agree with the teacher - it is better than a mere imitator, who thoughtlessly uses a formal set of skills-tools honed by his mentor. An excellent follow-up only emphasises the quality of the original product, what jealousy can there be?
The scramble behind the group began just as Andrei caught up with Scout and Tatiana. The former mercenary Kruger proved himself to be competent and quite mature here as well. The mechanic attacked the enemy on a "pick and shoot" principle. Grenades were thrown first, and then a firefight ensued. The mercenaries, under the command of the experienced but somewhat straightforward Zonder, were forced to reveal themselves and rearrange their plan of action, which was clearly not to their liking.
The fighting was taking place quite far away from the walkers, and therefore there was no way to help the Mechanic. Here, too, Kruger had calculated everything. With all his actions, he urged the walkers to keep moving, not to be distracted by secondary matters.
- Forward," Andrew gestured toward the hilltop.
- I beg your pardon?" said Scout warily, looking behind him. - Who's beating up there?
- The mechanic resurrected. - Andrey pushed the stalker forward.
- Indeed! A survivor? Nice one!
- Don't get distracted. There's a psychotronic emitter up ahead. Aimed squarely at us. "The Jokers will help, but you still have to show some willpower. Be ready.
- I'm a Scout. - Stalker grinned. - Always ready.
- Legs... - complained Tatiana. - As if they were cotton. Like a dream. I want to run, but my legs don't obey.
- I fly in my sleep," Scout admitted. - Well... ...sleep... you can do that. Sometimes I go up like that... the ground below... far, far away!
- Scout! - Andrei nudged his companion again.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
- Tanya, concentrate, - said Lunev, supporting his companion under his elbow. - The legs are all right, it's the emitter. When we get to the summit it will pass.
- ß... ...try... but I can't! - There was a note of panic in Tatiana's voice.
She stumbled and fell to her knees. Andrew, without thinking, picked her up in his arms and with a nod ordered Scout to follow.
- Watch out for the mercenaries behind them.
- Whoa!" Scout shivered involuntarily. - Now we're in trouble.
- Don't panic. - Andrzej moved resolutely up the slope.
Every meter was getting harder to walk, legs really got cotton, and his hands are filled with lead and almost did not let go precious burden, but Lunev climbed persistently. When it became impossible to hold Tatiana in his arms, Andrei put her, and then threw her on his shoulder. Tatiana gave a silent groan, but did not protest.
Her legs finally gave out though, but at that moment Lunev had already crossed the invisible boundary beyond which the effect of the emitter - a satellite dish mounted on a concrete bollard - had all but disappeared.
Andrei collapsed to his knees and then collapsed onto his side. Lunev had plenty of strength so far, thanks to the energy pump, but the nervous and mental strain literally paralyzed him. His body shuddered and he could not calm it down by willpower. Scout crawled up on all fours and was no help at all. He was shaking like a man with a fit. Stalker stretched out beside his commander and moaned something unintelligible, but clearly obscene. Helped both comrades Tatiana. She shook much less. The girl grabbed Andrew by the collar of his jacket and dragged him away from the emitter. Then she repeated the procedure with Scout.
Not to say that the walkers immediately felt better, but at least they stopped twitching like lab frogs under the current.
- Yoklmn! - Scout sat up and fumbled for his assault rifle with a trembling hand. - I'm gonna blow this thing to smithereens!
- No!" said Andrey, sitting down too on the damp twigs. - Hear, the firing has stopped? If the mechanic has failed, the mercenaries have followed our footsteps. Let them have some of it too.
- If he didn't make it? - Stalker lowered his weapon. - How many were there?
- A raiding party. Twelve men.
- Failed," Scout concluded confidently, and sighed. - 'So what do we do now?
- Go down. - Andrew, leaning on his machine gun, stood up and waddled across the tiny clearing at the top of the hill to the start of the descent on the north slope.
- If the winter was normal, he would ski... once, and down. - Scout, grunting, climbed up. - But this way we'll never get away.
- We go down, they go up, there is a chance, - said Andrey. - Move.
- Five seconds! - Scout leaned against a tree and began to pull off his boot. - The toe came off. I'll catch up!
Caught up with Scout even sooner. The thundering explosion thirty meters away made the stalker instantly put on his boots and in three jumps down to the level where his comrades had slowed down.
- What's the trouble? - Andrei glanced around anxiously.
- The transmitter's been blown! - A frightened Scout stared at his commanding officer. - Oh, a pro! They hit the saucer with the hinged one from the forest. The first grenade!
- Do you think? - Andrew shook his head in doubt.
- What for me to think, I saw it myself!
- The explosion was so ... More like a hand grenade exploded.
- Well, that sucks," said the stalker, sounding more worried. - So they're almost to the top.
- That's right. There's nothing holding them back now, only the opposite, the compulsion of the controllers.
- Shall we press on?
- Let's give it a shot.
The three made a fist of their own and hurtled down the slope, as if trying to flee an avalanche.
"The avalanche, as they soon found out, was faster than the walkers. For all their skill, Sonder's men could not run silently, which is why their stomping was soon heard literally at his back. Lunev could press on, but it was unlikely Tatiana was capable of it. She was running ahead, and Andrew could see that the companion is beginning to give up. A couple of times she almost stretched to her full height, tripping on pine roots. Scout seemed more alert, but he too was breathing heavily and occasionally clutching at his left side in an attempt to calm his spleen, aching for oxygen. Something had to be done immediately. Andrew drew one of his two remaining grenades from the pouch, jerked the ring out, and, glancing around for a moment, tossed it in the direction of the silhouettes flickering between the trees.
The explosion hardly slowed the mercenaries down much, but it forced the walkers to find internal reserves. Scout grasped Tatiana's hand and added seriously. Tatiana, too, pulled herself together and stopped stumbling.
Muffled gunshots clattered behind them and Andrew mentally prepared for a firefight, but, contrary to expectation, the bullets did not whistle around. This meant that the mercenaries weren't fleeing behind them, but were firing into the air, or in some other direction. Lunev slowed down and, having chosen more or less decent shelter, of the three pines growing almost closely together, stopped. The mercenaries were still running in the footsteps of the walkers, but their footsteps were not as loud now. The pursuit continued at the rate of two, the others - at least six more - had clearly stopped. It was clear who had forced the Zonder group to disperse. The mechanic held them off as far as he could on the southern slope, let them pass, and attacked again. All the right things. Except, perhaps, for one thing. The new attack should have been organised to the flank. Or better yet, they should have abandoned that tactic altogether and moved on to silently chopping off their tails. Andrzej would have done so, but Kruger, as always, had his opinion. Well, that was his fight.
Andrew coolly waited until the vanguard of mercenaries passed his cover, and with enviable rapidity put two bullets in the back of the head of the enthusiastic athletes. It was pure luck that the mercenaries hadn't seen the Old One merge into the trees, plus the "credit" to the controllers - no doubt about it. The creatures' control diminished their fighters' normal fighting abilities, and in turn, severely inhibited their ability to perceive reality as it used to be. Their vision was diminished, their hearing impaired, and their intuition turned off. But they couldn't be kept in check otherwise, so the enemy preferred to use the mercenaries' potential in half, but exactly as the controllers require.
Andrew turned again towards the approaching Zonder group and assessed the changes in the situation. They were serious and not in favour of the walkers. The mercenaries, despite the psi-control, were still dangerous and skilled fighters. They had finally located the Mechanic and were now driving him into a makeshift trap. Andrei could see that Kruger was surrounded, but there was nothing he could do to help Max. The mercenaries were moving very quickly, from tree to tree, so he was unable to shoot at least one on the fly, though he tried at least five times.
In the end, Lunev was also spotted and forced to move from a comfortable position down the slope. Meanwhile, the Mechanic, meanwhile, was clamped firmly in a pincer and forced to lie down by crossfire. As soon as Max lost his ability to manoeuvre, his fate was sealed. Andrei knew one hundred percent what was going to happen in the next minute, and so mentally bid Kruger farewell.
The Zonder fighters did exactly what Lunev had expected. They planted a couple of grenades in the ground near the Mechanic's position, and then closed the pincers, firing as they went. The sudden silence was something of a statement of fact - Max Kruger, aka the Mechanic, was dead. A single shot - a control shot - put a bold end to the "death certificate". Now no one was stopping the mercenaries from concentrating on the walkers.
Which they did. The short echo of the patrol shot had not yet died down, but the pursuit had already resumed. Andrew gauged the distance, the speed of the mercenaries, and concluded that a run would be futile. They could have easily outrun them, given the chance to depend on Joker, but as they were closing the distance, counting on an artifact to keep them at bay was becoming risky. The Joker was no match for point-blank range - a conclusion proven in practice.
Lunev chose a new position and prepared for firing contact. Andrei did not hear the steps of his companions behind him, and this reassured him a little. If the place of Scout and Tatiana Major Brazhnikov and mechanic - another matter, the two guns Lunev now would be of great use. As for the remaining walkers in the group... it was easier for Andrei to be alone. Less to worry about, more space and room for maneuvering. Strictly speaking, Andrei had only one concern left at all - to make sure his companions got far away and didn't think of coming back.
The mercenaries were already at an optimal distance, but Lunev failed to open fire. Someone in the rear of Zonder's group did it instead. This time the Mechanic was ruled out, but the mystery gunner could not be a random passenger either. Firstly, he was firing a special weapon, and secondly, it was not on the trail of any lucky coincidences. Of all the possible candidates Olga was the most realistic. Partly confirmed by the fact that the faint sound of firing (for the uninitiated - the sound is no louder than snapping fingers) sounded far from the positions of hiding behind the trees mercenaries and that none of the enemies fired back.
Andrei realised almost immediately what Olga was busy doing. The very thing for which Ostapenko had recruited her into Old's group. Shooting down the controllers. In response to the claps of the "shaft" sounded three panickedly long bursts of fire from the "Kalashnikov", then there was silence for a time, and finally clapped three more silenced shots.
That these three shots were the "final" shots, Andrew was soon convinced. The mercenaries hissed and began to back up in a westerly direction, trying to keep both the top and bottom of the slope in their sights at the same time.
For a second Andrew had Zonder himself in his sights. The leader of the raiding party was not wearing a mask, so Lunev could easily see his face. It was, to put it mildly, displeased and puzzled. The mercenary had a submachine gun in his right hand and was rummaging around in his sinuses with his left. Finding what he was looking for, Zonder pulled a strap with a leather pouch from behind the collar and clenched it in his fist. The mercenary's expression didn't change much after that. He still looked disgruntled and puzzled. Perhaps even more than before.
Andrei could tell with a high degree of certainty that he knew what the mercenary was thinking now. Like most mercenaries, Zonder was using an amulet, usually a pretty good shield against all kinds of psi influence. At least the usual controllers, psychotronic emitters and psi anomalies were no threat to a man with this amulet around his neck. However, even Zonder, not the sharpest of mercenaries, was aware that his group was still 'tricked' by controllers and amulets were powerless in this situation. Zonder was also able to draw the right conclusion from this fact, well done. To deal on the spot with such strong controllers would be foolish. They should simply leave while they had time to escape and only after returning to the base should they find out what kind of trouble they were in and how to deal with it.
Soon the blue group disappeared from sight, and Andrew relaxed. The mercenaries had gone off the trail, no doubt, and of the controllers, if any had survived, they could no longer do much harm to the walkers.
Lunev came out of hiding and stopped, listening. Olga seemed to be on the safe side and was in no hurry to rejoin the group. What was the reason for this, Andrei did not know. Maybe some of the creatures had survived, and the girl decided to hunt down the escaped mutant first, and then return to the general formation? Lunev stood still for a few minutes, but heard nothing and saw no one. Olga seemed to have vanished into thin air. It was unlikely that she had accidentally stepped off the path or died...
"Then there must be a reason. It is better to stop there for now. If she catches up, she'll tell me."
Andrew threw his weapon on his shoulder and strode resolutely down the slope.
It was not difficult for Lunev to find his comrades. Scout and Tatiana sat in a thicket at the foot of the hill and argued languidly, now emerging from the bushes, now gingerly looking in the direction of the forest on the hill.
- Andrei! - Seeing Lunev, Tatiana visibly cheered up. - I was so worried! What happened there?
- The mechanic is dead, - shortly summed up Andrew. - But he solved the problem.
- I am very sorry. - Tatiana sighed.
- First Brazhnikov, now the Mechanic," Scout grieved for a few seconds. - It seems that just now he "resurrected" and again ... gone. Life is a fiend.
- Debatable. What have you got?
- We have... - Scout didn't immediately switch to a new subject. - Us? Oh, it's no good either. I mean, end of the trail, that's good, but... See for yourself.
He pushed aside the bushes and looked across the field ahead. It was covered with yellow grass and some patches of scrub. The end of the path, mentioned by Scout, was clearly visible. It looked exactly like the "hole" through which Brazhnikov said the Thirteenth Sector creatures had entered the base. Except this circle was slightly larger.
Andrei had no doubt that it was the same exit from the sector as the one left at the base. However, the "entrance" path hardly led any further either. It simply had nowhere else to go. Along the edge of the clearing, just beyond the forty-meter diameter ring of greenish fog, stretched a long and tall, at least three stories high, rampart of rusted scrap metal.
"And once it had been a strategic military facility, the menace and pride of the armed forces."
Lunev had a good idea of what the "over-the-horizon" radar station in Chernobyl-2 had looked like when it was still a majestic iron wall, over seven hundred metres long and fifty metres high, a sort of monument to the iron curtain and the former defence power of the country. Now, looking at the rusted remains of the giant structure, one could only marvel at its scale and at how fast progress was moving. Today, what that radar did - and it tracked any missile launches in the other hemisphere - was handled much more quickly and efficiently (though not cheaper) by satellites.
In general, the entrance to the Thirteenth sector was located in the same place as the exit, there was no doubt about it. How to use it, however, was a serious question. Around the peculiar gate, forming in addition to the fog three more rings, at a distance from each other, stood a pile of sentries, each fighter holds a short chain, on which sits motionless, like a sphinx, a huge dog. Even if Lunev had a whole platoon of Special Forces at his disposal, rather than two "conditionally fit for duty" walkers, breaking through this cordon would have been problematic.
"No, if the spetsnaz had brought flamethrowers or five crates of grenades... "Maybe it would have gone off. Literally. There's not much you can do with submachine guns. These sentries don't seem to be any fighters. Just dead men. Dogs aren't a problem either. But on the other hand... A hundred and fifty of them and the same number of others. They'd be overwhelmed by the masses. What if we could get some of them to break through... a dozen boars, for example, to tread the path. But where to get them?"
Underlying these doubts Lunev had just one point that fundamentally distinguishes the cordon at the gates of Sector Thirteenth from any other guard, even reinforced platoon of dog handlers with their pets.
All the fighters and dogs were indeed... dead. No inverted commas. A hundred and fifty zombies and an equal number of dead dogs.
That's why Andrei had no hope of outgunning this ghastly guard, nor of turning them to flight or making them panic under barrage of fire. Bullets to the dead were like logs, and with emotion they too were exactly the same, i.e. nothing. It was difficult to find effective weapons against them at all. After all, none of the creators of standard weaponry counted on destroying an already dead enemy.
When stalkers first encountered this problem in the Zone, they had to be quite nervous before they understood who zombies are and how to deal with them. The only reason these creatures not even creatures, remains, rotted standing, sitting and moving on the surface of the earth rather than lying in it, was the anomalous energy of the Zone, and in this case the nearby hidden sector as well. Well, these goons attacked or built so beautifully at the will of the controllers who controlled them. That is, to cope with them, first of all they had to destroy their master, and then to burn the bodies of zombies, immobilized without the will of the controller. At the very least, they could be blown to smithereens with a grenade. Olga's favourite flamethrower was a good idea in such cases. Or five crates of "lemons", it occurred to Andrei.
Lunev went back, sat down on a mossy stump and stared questioningly at his comrades.
- What?" asked Scout.
- You tell me. You've been sitting here for a long time, discussing something. Anything on your mind?
- I say we go and find the keeper. - Scout pointed to the rest of the radar. - He's got to be in there somewhere.
- There's more than one of them. - Andrew shook his head in denial. - A dozen or two of them are hiding somewhere around here. We won't find them all in 24 hours. Tanya, what did you suggest?
- Exactly that. Wait for Olga. She'll find the controllers... all of them. Probably. And we'll kill them. Probably.
With each word there was less and less confidence in Tatiana's voice.
- We have no right to waste time," argued Andrew firmly. - Dozens of people die in the Borderlands every minute. We need to get to Sector Thirteen as soon as possible.
- A paraglider, then. - Scout hummed. - Vaughn, jump off the pile of scrap metal into the centre of the circle, and hello.
- Even if your ramblings weren't ramblings... - Andrew grimaced. - Remember what the Mechanic said. You can only enter the sector by ground. And I'm also sure the remnants of the radar lie beyond the trail. Whoever climbs them will land in an ordinary clearing.
- That's why we can't see the controllers! - Scout slapped himself on the forehead. - They're really just sitting on bent irons in a normal space, aren't they?
- Right," agreed Andrew. - For 'creative thought', curved space isn't an obstacle. That's probably how the controllers manage their invasion army, too. A few Coordinators take stock of the situation and report back to the others, who in turn command their flock directly from Sector Thirteen. Convenient and safe.
- Nice one! Why were these controllers trying to get to us personally?
- We're not mutants. - Andrew shrugged. - So, what else can we think of? Besides paragliders, rocket packs, and tanks lying around in the bushes.
- Yes! What else could we think of? - Scout sort of deflected the question to Tatiana.
- ß... don't know.
- You're science! What are you in the group for?
- Scout, get off," Andrei demanded. - We all think.
- ß... - The stalker glanced somewhere in the direction of the forest behind Lunev's back and visibly flinched. - Whoa! Yo... Pony Town Guard!
The deadwood crackled behind Andrei's back. Scout choked on the phrase and rolled his eyes, risking to lose them altogether. Turning in the same direction Tatiana silently groaned and froze like an ice sculpture. The last person to turn around was Andrei. Calmly assessing the situation, Lunev held Scout grabbing his gun, slowly rose and took a step in the direction of the forest.
A man standing on the edge of the forest, just opposite the walkers, did not react either to Scout's movements or to Lunev's step. The man stood swaying slightly, staring straight ahead.
In fact, as all zombies "look". It was hard to doubt that the man who had emerged from the forest was dead. Numerous wounds from shrapnel and bullet holes covered his whole body. The most noticeable mark from a bullet gaped exactly in the middle of his forehead. But most importantly, Andrei saw with his own eyes how this man had been killed a few minutes ago by mercenaries.
Lunev slowly approached the dead Mechanic and walked around him in a circle. Why his comrade's corpse was moving in space was a mystery that defied intelligible explanation, like all cases of zombies in the Zone, and so Andrew assigned it the number one hundred and sixteen. Much more important now was to understand why the Mechanic had come, and who had brought him. The questions were firmly connected, and the answer might as well have been one.
Andrew stopped in front of the Mechanic again. Krueger reeked of blood and forest sting. His body still held the remnants of warmth, and his glassy eyes were dry but not yet clouded. It was difficult for Andrei to look at his dead comrade, but Lunev hoped to understand what the controller who had brought the dead man here had "forgotten", so he didn't look away.
The mechanic suddenly stepped forward, and Lunev barely had time to move out of his way. Kruger broke through the bushes and moved toward the Thirteenth Sector Gate in a steady, almost regimented stride.
Dusk was slowly blurring the silhouettes and details of the dismal landscape, but visibility was still more or less decent. At least at a distance of two hundred metres it was not difficult to see what was going on. The sudden increase in rain did not make it difficult either.
The mechanic walked steadily at a medium pace, his footsteps stamping into the mud. Tall fountains of mud splashed from beneath his feet, but the mercenary never slipped on the slippery ground or tripped over any of the numerous bumps.
There was a great deal of noise from his movements, but none of the sentries so much as turned their heads toward the approaching zombie. Nor did the dogs react to his approach. "Fisherman sees fisherman from afar" and immediately forgot about him.
Nothing else had been expected by Andrei. It was still a mystery to him why the Mechanic had appeared, but his gut told him that there was no reason to panic yet. Kruger turned into one of the monsters, and in theory nothing good could be expected from him, but Lunev decided to see the show through to the end, and after the curtain to draw conclusions. Or legs.
When the mechanic reached the first line of cordon, the second and third came in motion - the zombies parted, letting the new tribesman to the cherished gate to their inside out paradise.
Krueger came close to the ring of greenish mist and stopped abruptly. The zombies didn't see it. None of the sentries looked behind the walker. After he passed the cordon, the zombies simply closed their ranks and stood there again, rotting ashen.
The mechanic did a fairly decent roundabout turn and slowly pulled a small duffel bag off his shoulder.
When Kruger took out of the bag one by one three familiarly shaped objects, Lunev became worried and raised his automatic rifle to his shoulder. Through the telescopic sight they could easily see the objects, despite the sudden dusk. They were NATO anti-personnel mines, but not simple, but a directional blast. Apparently, they were the ones the mechanic had mentioned back in the forest near Opachichi. If they were properly set, they could blast a sector of up to sixty degrees to the front and up to fifty metres in length. It was hardly realistic to destroy all three lines of cordon in half the circumference of the gate with three charges, but it was quite possible to throw aside at least a sixth of the sentries for a while.
"I told you, Max, we'll need the mines," thought Andrei. - And so it happened, my instincts were right. It's a good thing we saved them. Now we just have to break into the circle, and then we'll see. I don't know why, but it seems to me that these knuckleheads won't be so scary inside the "ring". I guess it's just my intuition again.
The mechanic slowly squatted down and stuck the mines in the dirt. He did it in such a way that three blasts cleared quite a large sector. Andrew gauged the kill zone and concluded that with a couple of grenades, he could cut a good enough gap in the zombie line. One problem - no later than twenty seconds, the pass would tighten. It worked out that the group would have to play along with Krueger and get as close to the cordon as possible, so that once a corridor was formed in the dead men's line, they could take advantage of it.
Having set the mines, the Mechanic took the remote detonator out of his bag and stood up to his full height. Lunev got a grenade and stood up too, ready to step out of the bushes at the first signal of the former mercenary, but he was suddenly held back by Scout.
- Look, commander, the radio ain't workin' out here!
- What are you talking about? - Andrey turned round and grudgingly glanced at the stalker.
- The radio! It won't work, it will die, and so will your communicator! The mines won't go off! The mechanic... or whoever's running it... ...is a waste of time!
- Get the grenades, - ordered Lunev.
- A dead end, I tell you! - Scout protested.
- I can see that he's not alive. - Andrew drew out his ring. - You can stay here if you're chicken. Tatiana, get the grenades ready.
- I don't know how to... use them.
- You don't have to. If I hold out my hand, you give it to me. Keep up. Follow me!
- Listen, Old One! - Scout tried to grab hold of Andrew's sleeve, and then Tatiana, but both firmly brushed off the stalker and went out of the thicket into the clearing.
Scout swore unintelligibly, spat in annoyance, took a grenade from his pouch, and followed.
The zombies and dogs didn't react as well to live humans as they did to a dead Mechanic. The first line of cordons hissed and slowly moved toward the humans. The dogs began to tug at their chains, tearing forward, snarling angrily, but, quite predictably, they didn't make a sound.
Nevertheless, the sound background over the clearing had changed. Besides the sound of rain, howling wind, and cawing crows in the nearby trees, there was the sound of heavy footsteps, the splash of water in puddles, the howling of sticky mud, and the clanking of numerous chains. Such a moribund soundtrack was perhaps even scarier than the sight of zombies mechanically striding towards them. From a distance it looked as if they were all dressed in a brownish-green camouflage, a camouflage created by the mud mixed with mildew that covered the tattered clothing. As they got closer, details began to emerge: cloudy whitish eyes, yellow slime oozing from wounds and mouths, and stains of decay on gray faces.
It was both frightening and disgusting. But it was different for everyone. Tatiana was mostly afraid of the dogs, tearing themselves from their chains. No sound came out of their mouths, but they were dripping greenish-yellow saliva, and some splotches were raining down. On closer inspection, they appeared to be clumps of small white worms.
When the group had no more than fifty meters to the cool embrace of the zombie, Andrew stopped and raised his hand with the grenade. The mechanic, towering like a beacon in the rear of the dead army thanks to his considerable height, repeated Lunev's gesture. It was noticeable that the body gradually ceases to obey the "new master", rigor mortis sets in, but so far the controller with Kruger's body managed. The mechanic slowly raised the console above his shoulder.
- Stand by," Andrew ordered his comrades in a low voice. - I'll throw a grenade, drop to the ground at once.
Lunev lowered and slightly withdrew his hand, but he did not hurry to throw the grenade.
- What are you waiting for?! - Scout got nervous.
Andrew did not answer. He waited a few more seconds and, when the zombies were at optimal range, threw the grenade.
Already from the "parterre" Andrew tossed both grenades given by Tatiana, trying to destroy as many monsters of the first line as possible. The effect of three explosions was minimal. Barely five or six dogs and three sentries were torn to shreds. All the other zombies were simply tossed aside by the blast wave. Considering that their bodies, unlike the Mechanic's, had long since passed rigor mortis, the monsters should have risen and returned to form fairly quickly, but still not faster than humans could run the cherished hundred-meter run to the "Hell Gate". The only problem was that the other two lines of cordon were virtually intact.
Andrei lifted his head and looked at the Mechanic. He was still standing behind the cordon, holding the remote in his hand. That was all. For some reason he was in no hurry to detonate the mines.
- I told you it wouldn't work! - With a hint of panic in his voice he whispered to Scout. - Let's get out of here!
He jerked away, but he caught hold of Scout's hood.
- Get down!
- Don't just lie there! There the dead men are getting up, they're waddling this way. They'll get their dogs down, and that's it!
- Get down! - Andrey lowered his head and pressed Scout to the ground.
The remote worked after all. Three powerful blasts shattered both remaining lines of the cordon, and even grabbed the fighters of the first line who managed to rise. Puddles have not yet spanked falling from the sky lumps of earth and fragments of dead bodies, and Lunev has already picked up comrades and literally dragged them to the "gate. The zombie survivors (or rather, their controllers) finally managed to let the dogs off their chains, but the dead dogs didn't run very well. Only two managed to nip Scout and Tatiana's legs before the humans were at the edge of the fog ring. The dogs failed to bite through the Kevlar, and when Scout stumbled backward to shake the creature off and stepped into the greenish haze, the dog, clawing at him, willingly released its grip and staggered backward, its shaggy tail tucked. Realizing that the misty border of the conventional gate was a forbidden place for zombies, Scout sharply pulled Tatiana to the narrow strip of land. The creature, firmly gripping Tatiana at the ankle, also unhooked himself and darted away from the ring.
- Old one, this way! - Scout called.
Andrew was half a step away from the fog, but did not hurry to hide in it. The same half step away from Lunev was the Mechanic. He stood, swaying slightly, completely unconcerned, but still supported by anomalous energy in an unnatural zombie state. He was no longer controlled by anyone, Krueger had completed his mission, and now no one needed his services. And that made it all the more frustrating for Lunev. Max had done so much both before and even after his death that he deserved peace. But what could Lunev do? Dig a grave and order the Mechanic to lie in it? But how can you order a zombie if you're not a controller, and it's of little use. Any creature could easily make a long-suffering body crawl out of the ground and send it hurtling through the Zone, until it rots and crumbles to the ground. What peace could there be? One could only hope for the goodwill of whoever was running Krueger. Somebody was running it. And, judging by the fact that that someone had helped the walkers, he had some concept of humanity. Even if he is the controller. If so, the former 'master' was simply obliged to put the body to rest.
"If, of course, such a thing is possible. Honestly, I've never once seen a zombie rest. Even abandoned by the controller, they still wander or stand pillars 'on standby'. And so to the end, until they rot or are swallowed by crows. So... the only real hope is to bomb the place and wipe out the Mechanic along with the other zombies."
Andrew, as if apologetically, patted the Mechanic on the shoulder and took a step back. Or rather, almost did. Krueger suddenly grabbed Andrei's arm, slowly turned in his direction and tilted his head slightly sideways. "Looking" Mechanic still in the middle of nowhere, and no thoughts in his eyes reflected, and could not reflect, but Lunev seemed to understand the meaning of the gesture and a peculiar nod of his former comrade.
- Scout! - Without turning around, Andrei called.
- What?" There was fear in the stalker's voice. - Why is he clutching at you?
- Give me the grenade. - Lunev held out his hand.
- And if he doesn't let go? You'll blow up with him!
- Come on!
Scout put a grenade in Andrey's hand. Lunev carefully took the amulet and the pouch with "Joker" from the neck of the Mechanic, hung the things on him, then pulled the ring and shoved the grenade Kruger behind the groove.
The mechanic immediately unclenched his fingers and turned his back to Andrei. So Lunev had done everything right. Andrew spread his arms, ordering his companions to step back, and finally took a step back inside the gate.
The walkers no longer heard the thundering explosion. From the thirteenth sector, all that was happening on the other side of the "ring" was a silent play of distorted silhouettes in a theatre of shadows. One moment the silhouette of a tall man was visible just at the fog line, and now he was already shattered into small fragments. A curtain. And most importantly, none of the fragments somehow made it inside the cherished circle.
"Probably for the same reason that dogs and other zombies didn't come in here. There's only an exit for the dead. Only the living are allowed in. Goodbye, Mechanic. Thank you and goodbye. Now that's for sure."</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a7_doc_8">
    <text>...There are no small things in a big business. Every detail can be decisive. The engineer had known this truth for a long time, but to be honest he had only recently begun to follow it rigorously. In December. After the failure of Operation Black Angel. After a seemingly insignificant mistake caused another collapse. It was no worse than the military attack in October but, like the autumn attack, it hit hardest. 
In fact, if Ostapenko's men had been smart enough, they could have ended the confrontation with the psionics back in December. The upstart mercenary, newly recruited by the general under his banner, had barely made it to the entrance to Sector Thirteen, where neither the psionics nor the creatures guarding the entrance were ready for his visit. The entrance path was much shorter in December, plus it ran through other areas, and Old, unknowingly, followed it from beginning to end. Were it not for the intervention of the men, the Engineer's new assistants, who had forced the mercenary to turn north at the last moment, the gate would have become a Polichinelle secret. And what would have followed is hard to imagine. 
So the destruction of the supernormality, and with it the armed group, which helped psionics subjugate the Zone devouring it like a cancerous tumor, Black Angel, was a painful blow, but again not fatal. When the old order of things was restored, the Engineer admitted to himself that the idea was crude. There was too much to consider and calculate in advance, and he had confined himself to a general idea and effectively let the matter run its course. 
Since then he has no longer ignored the minutiae, although his main focus remained on the main component, his last hope, the unique artifact "Key". He worked around the clock to devise the proper control algorithm for this crystal, and his titanic efforts were not in vain. He managed to create the first transition points while Operation Black Angel was still in full swing. Through these narrow tunnels the Engineer had released only a few dozen mutants from the Cloaked Sector into the outside world, but with each experiment he became better at making the transition wider, more stable, and longer lasting. 
The psionics were encouraged by his progress. The Ghost, who had barely kept his siblings from acting rashly when the second operation had failed, even allowed himself to remark that Angel's death might have been a point in the Engineer's career, but now... the brothers and sisters trust the leader again. 
The Engineer was well aware of that himself. Which was why he risked leaving the psionics in Ghost's care while he delved deeper into his work himself. To be honest, there was nothing else for him to do. The second course of action, the destruction of the disgruntled, which had worked before, wouldn't work now, no matter how much he wished. Everyone was dissatisfied, including the assistant and the loyal bodyguard sisters. But the "Key" had figuratively "turned in the lock" and the discontent of the psionics was replaced by a new wave of enthusiasm. 
The Engineer instantly found work for everyone, and most of all for Ghost. 
- To make the new project as secure as possible, we must take two important steps," the Engineer told his assistant at the time. - One: remove Ostapenko and destroy all his archives. People must be assured that the Zone is no longer hiding any big secrets from them. And the second step: throw our brothers behind enemy lines. When the decisive moment comes, they will have to get close to the ISI headquarters and arrange a session of mass hypnosis for the generals. Both tasks are of the highest degree of difficulty, and therefore I can only trust you to carry them out. 
- The second task is easier," Ghost remarked. - It doesn't take much to get a few Psionics out of the Zone. Makeup, contact lenses, and money. You could do without all that. The Brothers could easily convince those around them that they looked human. 
- No, they must conceal their gift until the last moment," the Engineer protested sternly. - Those who have been through the Zone will sense they are being attempted to obscure their minds. You must choose the most seasoned of all Psionics, those who can keep their composure even at the edge of failure. 
- All right, I'll do as you say. Kiev is far enough from the Zone, every day in this city will cost the brothers a week of life, but they will easily make this sacrifice, I am sure. The main thing is that in an emergency the headquarters won't be redeployed somewhere even further away from the Zone. If that happens, our brothers will die. 
- That won't happen. 
- Let's hope not. As for the first task... ...it's out of our hands. The General doesn't go into the Zone, and outside the Zone... I can only repeat: we grow weaker as we move away from the Zone. Until there are enough passages in the outside world through which the life-giving energy of the Zone can flow into the wilderness, we are tethered to that part of the terrain like chain-dogs. 
- You're wrong, Ghost. Outside the Zone our power remains, but it lies not in our superpowers, but in our wealth. We can easily turn the General's secret weapon against him. We wouldn't need to leave the Zone. I mean the mercenaries. Contact their middlemen, pay a fabulous sum, and they will do what we need. 
- Yes, that might work," said the Cloak, and outlined a sketchy plan in his head. "The first thing to do would be to destroy the archives, because the theft isn't exactly a high-profile crime, and it wouldn't make a lot of noise. 
- Right. The papers should be destroyed in your presence. 
- But there shouldn't be much time between the theft and the general's destruction. Inside the fork between the stocks, the mercenaries will be at great risk. 
- Pay them extra for the risk. Or hire two teams. 
- Yes, Engineer, that's what I'll do. I hope Ostapenko doesn't expect us to be so decisive. My only fear is that the reaction to destroying the general will be a sweep and sweeps. Our agents will be at serious risk. 
- What do you suggest? 
- Split the first task into two: destroying the archive and killing the general. The files will burn in an "accidental" fire, and Ostapenko will disappear once our invasion begins. In a combat situation it will be more difficult for people to orientate themselves and understand where the general has gone. Besides at this moment our brothers will work behind enemy lines and they will convince the headquarters that there is no time and no reason to look for the general. 
- You're a good tactician, Ghost. - The engineer was pleased with the plan. 
- Otherwise you wouldn't have had me as your assistant, Engineer. - In Ghost's mind the phrase did not sound impertinent, but rather respectful. 
That subtle nuance pleased the Engineer too. He was now absolutely certain that Ghost was the right person to help take into account all the little things that make such a big difference to the success of any major undertaking. 
"One head is good, but two is better. Especially with psionics..." .</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_faction_mar_a7_doc_9">
    <text>...But even better when the united mind of psionics is assisted by the brute force of mutants in a kind of "network". The Engineer now knew this for certain. The outside world was on the brink of a new catastrophe, all thanks to this fortunate combination of psionic abilities and the power of the creatures.
Satisfied with the news from the outside world, the Engineer felt an emotional lift. The only thing that bothered him was a vague understanding of why the problems of long ago days were suddenly being recalled. How were the events of December and current affairs related? Why had memory pushed to the surface these particular facts and episodes?
The appearance of Ghost nearby helped the Engineer to find answers to all the questions at once. Or perhaps the Ghost himself helped find them. For example, if he gave a clue. Just as stealthily as he appeared.
- Did you say something? - The engineer looked at Ghost inquisitively.
- I couldn't take every little detail into account, I'm sorry. - The assistant lowered his gaze.
- You're thinking of two things at once, I don't understand, you're barely asking for forgiveness?
- It's not my fault that the General is unreachable. His archive burned down as we planned, agents set fire to the counter-intelligence building as soon as the operation started. But Ostapenko himself is now in D-3. At the very base we can't take. Our brothers are suggesting to HQ that the garrison should be withdrawn. Once that happens, either our creatures or the mercenaries will get to the general.
- Yes, circumstances were above us. It's not your fault. But what is it, then?
- I lost five more brothers. The men deceived us. Or rather, one of them... one... a woman. She's so immune to telepathic pressure that we... didn't actually see her. She burned the four brothers easily and quickly, as if they were matches. She flicked them on a box and burned them!
- A woman?
- Yes. Young and... very strange.
- Interesting. - The engineer took a long pause. - I don't understand why the psionics let her get so close. In addition to the telepathic gift, they have keen hearing and smell and sight. What happened to them before this woman attacked them?
- Nothing. That's the point. But none of them had time to react to her attack. And the fifth of the dead brothers couldn't defend himself with telepathy or firearms. The woman crept up and killed him a hundred metres from the gate.
- Doubly entertaining. Where are the men now?
- They're in. But the strange woman isn't with them. Just the other, older, normal one.
- Plus the stalker, the mercenary and the Old One, right?
- We killed the mercenary. That leaves the Old One and the stalker. And the other woman.
- Are they coming?
- Not yet, standing still. Probably waiting for the woman we lost.
- I'll go up and have a look at them.
The engineer took a crystal from the altar-stone, placed it in a setting attached to a silver chain, and hung the precious pendant around his neck. Then he walked to the far end of the hall and pushed open an inconspicuous door in the wall. Behind the door was a small landing in front of a spiral staircase. In principle the Engineer could have had a lift built into the castle long ago, or he could have had the ruins pulled down and replaced it with a proper building, but that was of no interest to his master. The Psionics didn't need a place to live. Their home was the whole Zone, and their study or bedroom, in a word, a secluded place in the house, was the Thirteenth Sector.
So the ruins of a medieval castle, unknown how it had come to be in these parts, were a purely symbolic retreat for the Engineer. A place for meditation. When the Engineer entered the castle, all psionics knew at once that their master wished to be alone, and they did not pester him about the smallest things. They did not even look into the castle. No one but Ghost. But even he never went up to the roof of the only surviving room, the hall with the hole in the ceiling. To be honest, not at all because he was afraid. There was simply nothing for him to do there. If he had to find out what was going on in the far reaches of the sector, the Phantom could go there himself. He had no interest in exploring the surroundings. What could attract or surprise him in the dull landscape? Decidedly nothing.
Still, if the Phantom had gone up with the Engineer and watched his master's reaction to what he saw, the Assistant would have been very surprised. And if he had read the Engineer's mind at that moment, he would have been even more surprised.
Darkness was thickening over the sector, but the scant lighting did not prevent the Engineer from seeing what he wanted to see. It wasn't just with his eyes that he 'looked'. The abilities given by the Zone allowed him to perceive much more than the normal senses would provide. The people Ghost described had indeed entered the hidden sector, but they were no longer standing at the gate, but moving slowly forward. Surprisingly, they followed the path leading to the castle. This was the first time the Engineer had seen these people, but their psi envelopes were very familiar to him.
He had studied the Old One's mental aura back in October, when the stubborn mercenary had stumbled upon two sources of the Call, figured out exactly where the false target was and where the real one was, and headed for the bunker's underwater gate. At that moment the Engineer paid no attention to the mercenary's cleverness. He was sure that the catfish would devour the arrogant upstart and close the matter without the intervention of psionics. But that was not the case. And when Old reappeared in his field of vision, the Engineer had to take a closer look at his aura. The Old One was very strong, but there was nothing unusual about him. However... What was unusual was that after six years in the Zone, the man hadn't changed one bit. More than enough to take the Old One at face value. And since this is the third time he has tried to sabotage the operation - more than enough to destroy him.
The retired mercenary's companion did not seem as interesting, though she, too, held particular potential. Not as much as Old, but still. And this was not the first time she had come into the Engineer's field of vision, either.
As for the stalker, the Engineer was quite clear about him. No, not because this Scout was the most typical member of his "shop" or the average specimen of the Zone. The woman was average, too, but at least she interested the Engineer a little. This fruit didn't. At all. The reason the stalker was of no interest to the Engineer was because this man had no secrets behind him. What interest in nothing if you're not a baby?
The second woman had not yet been seen on the horizon, nor had the Engineer caught any sign of her approach in the mental ether, but he did not hurry. He remembered Ghost's words well. The strange woman knew how to conceal her presence from telepaths.
"Not from me! I'll wait until she enters the sector, then we'll see what this thing is all about."
There was every reason for such ironclad confidence. The Engineer was originally the best of the psionics, and his abilities were greatly enhanced by the crystal hanging around his neck.
"A hundred to one I'll detect that woman's psi-shell in the mental ether before I see her with my eyes! Even a thousand to..."
The engineer cut himself short in a half phrase and stared into the twilight in surprise.
"One in a hundred," he winced. The woman emerged from the misty circle of the gate, the Engineer saw her, but telepathically failed to grasp her presence.
"What a trick! - The Engineer touched the crystal involuntarily. - Who is she?"
The artifact seemed to take the question personally and kindly gave a hint. Before the Engineer's mental gaze flashed a momentary snippet of the very haunting episode that kept popping up in his mind. The episode of the first victim. No, this woman was not it. Even mysticism had its limits. It was a different person.
"Although she was very similar to my first victim. No, it wasn't her after all. Firstly, it can't be, and secondly, she's much younger. And she doesn't look like her, what nonsense!"
It suddenly dawned on the Engineer... The strange feeling that he recognised this woman had a right to exist after all. He had indeed seen her before, and it had happened at exactly the moment that the Engineer had no way of forgetting. This mysterious young stranger was the second woman that the Engineer's first victim had not allowed to be devoured by covering herself.
In part, everything fell into place. The coincidence was certainly entertaining, but no longer had a mystical overlay. "Small world," as people put it, and what about the Zone? A tiny patch of land, crowded with a huge but relatively constant number of people and creatures. Meeting an old acquaintance at least once every six years - what's so surprising?
The engineer shook his head grudgingly. What he had been doing for the last few seconds was simply called: self-delusion.
"To meet an acquaintance... Once every six years... a small world... it's all bullshit, nonsense! Meeting and getting to know an old friend is not the same as meeting and getting to know someone you have glimpsed, sideways, through a dust veil! Seeing, getting to know and being absolutely certain you're right. No mysticism? What is there? Another hint, a vague clue from the depths of the Flash-covered memory? Why did I think it would be too much to eat this girl? Because I'd known her in a previous life? Because she was someone close to me in my former life, a relative? So what? There is nothing left of that person in me now, except a nickname. I am not a human being now, and I do not care about sentiments and attachments, as they say! But... I wouldn't gobble it up even now. Why not?"
The engineer tried to concentrate and still mentally "get" the strange woman. The result was quite impressive - zero. Neither his own talent nor the pumping of the crystal helped the Engineer penetrate the woman's mind. It was unpleasant to admit, but she was stronger than the leader of all the psionics of the Zone. The master of all thinking beings and creatures!
No, of course it was only her defences that were stronger, in terms of psi attacks she could hardly beat the Engineer. And her defenses only held up under the onslaught of a single psionic. Three or four of them would crack that nut, no doubt about it! Of all this the Engineer was certain, but such certainty did not dampen his curiosity in the slightest.
'I want to meet her face to face and talk to her. - The Engineer slammed down on the stone railing of the roof. - 'And if she has a new version of psi talent, I just have to get her on my side! That kind of manpower can't be wasted. This isn't some covert psionic who's never been much of a spy, either! Speaking of which, I never got to meet him, but I guess it's too late to regret that now. But this woman isn't just a psionic, she's an entirely different option. Definitely have to meet her!"
The Engineer was not disgusted with himself now, for he was thinking relatively soberly, at least no longer engaging in self-deception. But a flicker of doubt lingered in the back of his mind. Something about this situation was wrong. There was a catch. The engineer did not understand what it was, but he could sense it was there.
"No concrete thoughts, nothing to boot," the Engineer chided himself. - 'We've got to go downstairs. Out in the fresh air the imagination is too wide open. And instead of sharpening it, it perverts. You can get paranoid that way."
Downstairs, the Engineer was met by the Ghost again.
- Did you see them?
- Yeah.
- Any thoughts?
- Yeah. Keep them out of the way. Let them reach their destination.
- Do not interfere? - The ghost was very surprised. - And do what? Help?
- Nothing. If the group managed to pass all the tests of the trail, it means that the Zone has some kind of considerations for these people. I'm curious to know what they are.
- The Zone? What's the Zone got to do with it? The group was sent by Ostapenko. And now I'm sure he sent it specifically for you. The general realized he wasn't dealing with the Borderland morons or the bigwigs from the mainland, but with us. Figured it out and sent in this strange group. Now that they've entered the sector, it's not just the mercenary who reeks of death. Everyone is dangerous! Even the women, even the stalker. Ostapenko is plotting some particularly sophisticated provocation, I'm sure!
- In that rare case when we with General Ostapenko may completely coincide," said the Engineer quietly. - I will succumb to his provocation and allow the men to approach the castle. They intrigue me.
- Perhaps that was the reaction the General was counting on. Otherwise, I find it very difficult to explain what he did. He sent his best agents straight into the thick of it, to their certain deaths. You don't do that without a plan that's been thought through many moves in advance.
- It's possible. But then all the more reason for me to take a look at these people. And even talk to them. Otherwise we won't understand the enemy's plan.
- Maybe you need someone from this group in particular. Together, these people are too dangerous. I mean, we've both sensed that. It's hard to predict how things will end if they come here. Think again, Engineer, think hard! Unfortunately, all the brothers are dead, but there are three more sisters in the castle. We are much stronger in our own territory than in the outside world. The four of us can stop these people.
- No, we shouldn't bother the sisters. I thought very well. Let the people try to make it. If they succeed, therefore, there is someone among them worth risking it for. And I feel that it is. Which means our meeting will surely end safely, I'm sure.
- And if you're wrong?
- Then I will personally destroy them all. Do you doubt my ability to do that?
- No, I have no doubts.
- Then go deal with the general and that stubborn base in Dityatki. I'll meet the men and lead them to the light of truth. Or to death. Whatever it takes.</text>

    <text>It would be logical to expect that at the very gates of the group will meet a serious barrier of controllers or local particularly well-fed mutants, which easily and casually interrupt the mission of walkers. At the very least, some powerful anomaly could serve as a filter. But neither the former nor the latter happened. The group emerged unhindered from the ring of greenish fog, stopped and turned their heads for about five minutes, trying to get their bearings in the new terrain. So long to stay in one place was dangerous even in normal sectors of the Zone, let alone an enemy beachhead, but so far the Thirteenth sector only put pressure on the walkers morally.
Anomalies, mutants and controllers were undoubtedly present nearby, but the men could not detect them, no matter how hard they tried. Perhaps there was some sort of buffer zone around the gate, the boundaries of which were invisible to the walkers but well known to the locals. Or there was a path through the sector, similar to the one the group had followed, on which only those who knew where the starting position was could appear.
One could speculate for a long time, but it would not change the point in any case. So far people had experienced only understandable moral discomfort. After all, the landscape that greeted the group was seriously different from the usual views of the Zone, and, understandably, not for the better.
The landscape was almost unchanged. Behind the group was a wooded hill, and to the left and right stretched a field. But the vegetation was different in many ways. On the hill stuck out the same pines, only with charred trunks and dead red needles, but ahead, where in the outer zone rose iron wall of bent structures mutilated anomalies radar, stood impassable forest, the dusk looked something like a wall in Chernobyl-2. Huge lanky oaks with powerful barky branches grew so close together that even small creatures like jerboas or rats would have difficulty squeezing between their trunks and intertwined branches. The eerie fairytale forest was no taller than the dead pine forest on the hillside, but seemed to loom over the walkers. And it was at least a hundred and fifty yards away. The intricately curved branches of the mighty oaks seemed to be covered with black foliage. It was not surprising, as we know that even withered leaves fall from oaks reluctantly, but the crowns of these giants were not dry. Moreover, they were moving and periodically became more lush. A closer look revealed that the branches of the fairy trees were not covered by foliage at all. It was a huge flock of crows. The birds fought fiercely for the heated spots, flying up and then back again on the branches. Interestingly enough, the crows made almost no sound. At first Andrew thought these creatures were as dead as the dogs of the gate's outer guard, but he soon realized the point. The sound of birds howling was drowned out by the strange wind blowing relentlessly from the southwest.
Not only was the wind strange in that it did not blow in gusts but continually, like a wind tunnel, but that it could not be felt on the ground. One could guess that it moved only by the swaying of the branches. One could feel it only if one stretched out his hand upwards and even then it was perceived only by the tips of his fingers. The wind must have forced the crows to fly upwards, but then to return to empty branches. Roughly speaking, it blew them away from their settled places and at the same time carried away their guttural cawing.
At first Andrew thought that it was good not to fear the attack of batmen, who hardly like such conditions, but soon Lunev realized that he was mistaken. The mutants paid no attention to such trivialities. On the contrary, they even used the crazy air currents as a booster.
But that realisation came a little later, and for now the sector continued its psychic assault without resorting to its inhabitants. The striking fairytale forest drew the eye, but his gut told him that this part of the landscape was not at all the most interesting or dangerous thing to be found near the sector's main gates.
It took a lot of effort for Andrew to tear his gaze away from the gloomy thicket and turn his attention to the field, covered with low mounds to his right. In the twilight the field resembled a stormy sea. The mounds seemed to move like high waves, and in the same direction that the strange wind was blowing. The resemblance to the sea was augmented by wisps of mist or haze that looked like foam bubbles and wafted over the hilltops, but was absent from the gaps. Smoke puffs also seemed to flow with the waves, puffing lazily and occasionally forming strange rippling compositions. It even seemed to Andrei that several times the haze formed weightless figures of people, or maybe humanoid monsters - it was impossible to see these "sculptures" due to the fluidity of the landscape.
Andrew glanced over the open terrain to his left - flat as a table - and noticed that the tall grass and shrub patches on it sloped in the same direction as the mounds on the right. Because this part of the terrain rested on the western horizon and was not framed by forest, the flat field was brighter than anywhere else. He could see even the farthest edge of the field where some movement was looming. Andrei raised his rifle and examined the creatures scurrying in the distance through the optics. The quadruple optics didn't help him see the details, but overall it did the job. Lunev saw the main thing - the creatures were two-legged and gradually approached.
Andrei lowered his weapon and glanced around the field once more. There were quite a few obstacles in the way of the creatures. Despite the seemingly harmlessness of the field, it was generously dotted with anomalous areas. Piles and piles of bones, decaying remains, and scatterings of the very large artifacts the Mechanic had spoken of were eloquent proof of that. A light slanting rain, which, incidentally, did not react to the wind, as if there was no wind over the field, clearly marked the location of the anomalies. In some places, it was spraying water dust, and in other places, it spiralled. Sometimes a meter and a half before they hit the ground, raindrops suddenly changed direction and flew off parallel to the ground into the gathering darkness.
How the two-legged inhabitants of the sector were going to get through the minefield was anyone's guess. Perhaps all these gravitational anomalies had no effect on them, or perhaps they knew the secret path. Besides, Andrei personally wondered how the creatures were going to maintain the exact direction to the gate. After all, the field of anomalies "flowed" in the same direction as the field of mounds.
In fact, the whole mysterious sector seemed to be slowly flowing somewhere towards the northeastern horizon. Perhaps it was just an illusion, but so far Lunev could find no confirmation of the unreality of what was happening. After three minutes of watching this "flowing", Andrey shifted his gaze downwards and it seemed to him that the ground beneath his feet was also flowing somewhere, and with it the walkers were gliding smoothly. The "witch oaks" were loping all over the place, but if he peered closely their tops were also pointing northeast.
- This is creeping," Scout muttered softly, confirming indirectly that even if the "current" was an illusion, it was the work of the sector, not Lunev's imagination.
- You turn around," suggested Tatiana.
The advice turned out to be sound. The wooded hill behind them looked like an unshakable cliff in the illusionary stream. Neither it, nor charred pines on its slope did not flow or slope anywhere. Most likely because this hill was also a borderland in the Thirteenth Sector, partly belonging to the more stable outside world.
The sight of the hill had a beneficial effect on perception. When the walkers turned again to the northeast, neither the mounds, nor the shrub-covered field, nor the ominous oak woods were floating anywhere. The illusion had dissipated, leaving only a feeling of incomprehensible unease in the hearts of each of the walkers.
To get rid of an unpleasant feeling, Lunev even drew from a sinus amulet and firmly clenched it in his fist, and remembering the amulet Mechanic, took a handful of it. Close contact with artifacts helped to dull the anxiety, but Lunev was not able to get rid of it completely. Most likely because most of the anxiety was not externally induced, but formed in the subconscious. The longer the group was in the sector, the greater this personal unease became. Illusions, anomalous radiation and other local factors had nothing to do with it.
- I don't like it," Andrei involuntarily voiced the conclusion of his doubts.
- And you thought it was going to be paradise here? - Scout grinned. - A normal hellish landscape.
- That's not what I mean.
- Why aren't we under attack? - involuntarily pressed against against against Andrew, Tatyana muttered.
- Exactly.
- Maybe they are waiting when we go away from the gate? - Scout suggested. - There are so much bones and leftovers over there on the left... ...it's horrible! This one's clear.
- Shall we stand here? - Tatiana asked apprehensively.
- We'll just go through barrows, - said Andrey.
- And go where? - Scout grimaced. - You promised that once we are in the Thirteenth, it would dawn on you why the hell we are here. Did it?
- Not yet. But nothing's happened yet. It needs some kind of trigger. Something's got to happen.
- Oh, shit! - Scout nervously adjusted his gun belt. - Waiting for a sign! Or when we get eaten.
At the end of the group's fifth minute in Sector Thirteen, the "sign" finally happened. More than one. Unfortunately, it turned out that mutants have no taboo on outrages in the vicinity of the gate. Local fauna finally decided that the guests had had enough of the view, and began to intensively crawl out of all the crevices to say hello. Or snack. The reason of the five-minute pause was a mystery to the group.
The first thing that came down from the sky, as gray and low as in the outside world, was an imposing flock of batsmen, the claws of which were evaded by sheer luck. The wind had accelerated the creatures to high speeds, and they had miscalculated the time at which to release their claws and claw at people's shoulders.
A quick burst of fire from the flock cost the mutants one of their congeners, who instead of flying upwards with the others, continued their horizontal flight, crashing with a bang into the intricate branches of the 'fairy-tale' forest.
The result, frankly, was nothing. Especially when you consider that Andrew and Scout had spent almost a full magazine on anti-aircraft fire. That is why, when the flock, having executed a dead loop, again dived into the air current and raced at the walkers, the trio preferred simply to fall to the ground at the last moment. Once again the creatures, having been left with nothing, were not at all disappointed, but with the same enthusiasm rushed away on another turn.
- We must go to the forest! - Scout shouted, watching the maneuvers of the flock.
- Not even one meter into it! - Protested Andrew. - We're going to the mounds!
- And there, where the pines are... Closer, - suggested Tatiana.
- No. - Andrey waved to the right. - Over there, run!
Lunev's companions soon became convinced of Lunev's rightness. Chilling howls, heavy footsteps and the cracking of branches could be heard from the pine forest on the hillside. Whatever it was that was howling, the walkers had no need to meet it. Between the mounds, meanwhile, nothing frightening was happening. Mist lingered on the summits, darkness gradually thickened in the hollows and ghostly silhouettes appeared sporadically. Andrew supposed that these silhouettes were not simply the play of wind and fog, but that the howling and flying material beings seemed more dangerous to him now than the ghostly ones.
As the group approached the hills, the imaginary ghosts faded into mere wisps of mist, and once again Andrew thanked his intuition for the right clue. Another thanks to Lunev's professional intuition was expressed by Scout when the pack of "batsmen" corrected their course and tried again to attack targets running seemingly to their doom.
When the pack was already within a few metres of the fugitives, Andrew literally knocked his comrades down and forced them to fall into a narrow hollow between two mounds to the left of the route. The feint resulted in the pack suddenly having a three-metre high earthen berm in its path. Most of the monsters managed to soar into the sky, but a couple still crashed into the obstacle and ploughed two deep furrows on top of it. Lunev leaped to his feet and easily finished off the knocked out creatures and gestured for his companions to rise.
- Next time don't wait till I thrust you into such a trench! Fall by yourselves, preferably in different directions!
- In the very mud! - Scout shook himself off somehow, grumbling. - Oh, thank you! You could have shouted, why did you push?
- You'll get over it. Did you hear what I just said?
- I heard you, I ain't deaf. Fall in different directions. Which way are we going?
- Straight ahead.
- Oh, I can't," Tatiana said suddenly, frightened. - On my legs as if weights. Andrew! What is this disgusting!
- Damn!" with a quick glance at his companion legs Old interjected. - Scout, get the knife, help!
On the legs of Tatiana no weights hanging. Where would they come from, and who would hang them? In fact she was restrained by huge worms around her legs to the knee. They were half a meter long, fleshy worms, rising from under the turf, ploughed by the Batwoman, and spreading out, seeking either new cover or food. Deftly working with knives, the companions quickly freed Tatyana from the living chains and, taking her under the elbows, carried her away from the dangerous ravine. Tatiana barely touched the ground with her feet. When her comrades put her back on the ground, Tatiana involuntarily cried out in pain and almost fell over. Close acquaintance with the worms did not go in vain.
- If you stand, there are no breaks," concluded Scout. - Just a little bruised, maybe dislocated. Try a step.
Tatiana took a step and cried out in pain again.
- "Joker will help," said Andrei confidently. - In half an hour all will be gone. In the meantime we'll carry her on her haunches. Scout, first.
- The carriage is ready. - Stalker turned his back to Tatiana and slightly sat down.
- Shall I do it myself?
- Sit down, don't be shy," Scout encouraged. - You have time for yourself.
- Faster! - demanded Andrew. - "Batmen" are coming back!
Tatiana sat down on Scout's back, but the stunt did not lead at all to what Andrew had hoped for. From her new position Tatiana saw what her companions had not seen and immediately reported it to the Old One.
- Andrew! You can not go forward! There are some ... bugs!
- What more bugs?! - Andrew riskily climbed the nearest mound, assessed the situation and barely managed to jump into the hollow.
Just as he landed, a flock of pesky batmen flew over the walkers' heads again. To be sure, Lunev lost his balance and dropped to all fours. Scout also managed to collapse to his knees, and Tatiana ducked, and again the claws of the mutants found no target.
- Someday they will know better than to barrage and hover," Scout muttered as he got up. - Then we'll get the full force of it.
- They'll get it too. - Andrzej turned around uneasily. - There's no turning back. Those mounds... aren't really mounds. They're almost all dead here, but they're very much alive further on. Let's go back.
- Back is back. - Scout's turned around. - Wait, what do you mean? Who's alive? Those bumps?
- They're not knolls, they're shells," Tatyana said in a low voice. - Giant beetles! They are so heavy, they can not get over each other, so they are stuck in this field.
- Plague! - Scout stared at Lunev in surprise. - Really? Is there a traffic jam on the Beetle Loop?
- Sort of. - Andrew pointed to a clearing with a gate. - Going back.
- Something attracted them," Tatiana explained. - They came, but the first ones couldn't move on, and the last ones still can't overcome the attraction... I don't know to what. Maybe to the gate? So it turned out that the first ones died and the last ones are still living, devouring the corpses of those stuck in front.
- Worms in them, then, like maggots? - Scout grimaced. - This place stinks, nastier than a clearing with dead men.
- We`ll have to go through a field with anomalies, - Andrey concluded. - Bad that we lost time, it will be dark soon.
- And I told you! - Scout jerked his passenger slightly, trying to make her more comfortable.
- You were talking about the forest. - Lunev halted at the edge of the anomalous field and glanced over at the circling batsmen in the sky. - Hopefully, at least we'll get rid of them.
- Oh, we'll get stuck in some kind of vortex," Scout muttered grudgingly. - We'll be glad to be rid of the batsmen. No other joys left, that's for sure.
- Don't caw. - Lunev pointed behind him with his thumb. - A transfer!
- Don't you trust me?
- Oh, on the contrary, I do. You're a stalker, so drive.
- Drive! - Scout helped Tatiana to saddle the new charger and rubbed her shoulders. - I will lead, what questions, but to know still - where to? What to hold direction at least?
- We must go round this dense oak wood, and then... we'll find our bearings. Most likely, we'll have to set a course for Pripyat.
- To what? What's Pripyat?
- Well, if we were walking in a normal Zone.
- Oh, I see. All right, let's do it. So for the time being, we'll stick to the oak tree.
- But we don't go close to it!
- Afraid of being caught by the branches and dragged into the thicket?
- Anything can happen.
- No, old one, hold your horse! - Scout grinned, but nervously, even a little fearfully. - You're not making this up, not at summer camp, are you? The sector is odd, I'll grant you, but not that odd!
- I warned him, and then...
The old man didn't have time to finish his sentence. The air around the walkers suddenly crackled like torn parchment and simultaneously filled with a booming buzz. Only Tatiana could assume that the group was attacked by a swarm of abnormal bumblebees, but she assumed nothing of the sort. At least out loud. Her companions all the more did not suspect that a strange sector was to blame for the new problem. The nature of the sounds was abundantly clear to them. It wasn't bumblebees buzzing around, but heavy slugs.
Andrey sharply turned around, almost dropping Tatiana, and raised his gun, but did not shoot. The shooter, who came out of the gate, was not aiming at the walkers. All his bullets have hit the target, but these targets were not people, and surrounded them in a tight ring of invisible things. In keeping with the laws of the genre, the blood on the wounded monsters and the bodies themselves, if a successful shot killed the creature on the spot, became clearly visible. In appearance they were typical bloodsuckers, but again, like everything in Sector Thirteen, larger than their relatives in the outer Zone. They were not, however, any more invisible. As long as the monster remained intact, there was no way to see it. Not even in the rain. But if they could mark it, the wound made a good target.
- Thank you, good man! - Scout shouted, raising his gun. - Hold on, you bastards!
- Scout, lay off! - Tatyana down, shouted Andrew. - I'll tag them, you finish them off!
Lunev has thrown the automatic device behind a back and has got knifes.
- What the hell do you think you're doing? - Scout indignantly. - Knives?! Are you out of your mind?!
- Get out of his way! - The gunner shouted from a distance. - Do as he says!
Scout could hardly keep from another retort, nodded at Tatyana and ordered her to stand behind him and lifted his gun. Lunev, meanwhile, took a couple of steps forward, spread his arms with knives to his sides and... closed his eyes.
From the outside it might have seemed pure madness - to go against the superior forces of the enemy with two knives, and even close your eyes. But when you think about it, it was the only way to fight invisible men. You couldn't shoot someone you couldn't see from a distance. But you could feel him, sense his warmth, sense the movement of the air, and smell him when you got close to your enemy. You don't have to keep your eyes shut, of course, but it's still useful. To focus more fully on the remaining five senses in the formation.
Andrew didn't mark the first bloodsucker, but killed it on the spot just a second after closing his eyes. Two more - making a spectacular throw to the right - Lunev stabbed almost simultaneously. As soon as Andrey pulled out his knives, two short bursts of fire crackled, and heavy bullets struck exactly at the targets marked by Lunev. And Old was already on the other side of the frozen in the centre of an invisible ring Scout and Tatiana. He was attacked by what felt like three monsters, but nothing good came out of such an attack, and could not. The creatures only hindered each other and immediately paid for it. Andrey ripped two of them open from navel to throat, the third was marked and sent with a kick outside the conditional ring. There the marked creature was pacified by Scout. Two more bloodsuckers were taken out by the gunman. Lunev heard the bullets sink into their bodies with muffled slaps and the monsters heavy into the smacking mud. The shooter, like Andrei, was not hindered by the mutants' camouflage. Only it turned out that the shooter was even more talented. He could pinpoint the location of the invisibles not by touch, but remotely.
"If he's a controller, no wonder," Andrei thought to himself. - It's just not clear why he's helping us."
In principle, this gunslinger could be the same controller who had brought the Mechanic's group to their aid an hour earlier. Then his involvement in the fate of the walkers was partly understandable, but in general the motives of the controller, who sided with the people, still seemed incomprehensible.
However, Andrei was not in the mood for speculation now. The situation remained very complicated. The bloodsuckers had not yet retreated, moreover, the restless "batsmen" were once again targeting the walkers. This was briefly reported by Scout. The battle on two fronts had become too much of a challenge even for Lunev.
Andrei fought off an attack by two more mutants and finally decided to open his eyes. What he saw was quite satisfactory to him. A flock of flying creatures was circling above them at a decent altitude and was in no hurry to descend. Most likely this, too, was the merit of the controller who came to the rescue. Lunev turned toward the gate. In the darkness, a greenish fog around the point of entry glowed faintly, but did not properly illuminate the gunner's figure. Andrei could make out a human silhouette, that's all. Neither the dimensions of his ally, much less his special features, were visible to Lunev. He tried to remember the voice, but he could not say who it belonged to. Lunev had a suspicion that the shooter was Olga, but in that case the version about the telepathic ally collapsed. Olga had some abnormalities, Lunev had known for a long time, but so far the abnormalities had been limited to being immune to hypnosis, not to possessing that talent, and in such a suspicious form - almost like a controller. That is to say - a mutant!
Andrew returned to "his sheep", but it turned out that the bloodsuckers are no longer around. On the battlefield blindly left a dozen ugly corpses and one still alive, a mutant. Lunev wasted no time or energy on the wounded creature. Stashing his knives, he ordered Scout to put Tatiana back on his back and pointed to the barely visible in the dense twilight to the far edge of the dense forest. Scout nodded and, putting on his NV goggles, cautiously moved along the edge of the field, which was solidly covered with anomalies, bones, remains, as well as large and particularly powerful artifacts.
The last point was important to Scout, triggered reflexes professional stalker, and he managed to grab at least a dozen artifacts in passing.
- You have... have nothing to do? - Breathing heavily, asked Andrei.
- Habit! - Scout threw up his hands. - Can't you? I can throw it away.
- The main thing is not to look through the anomaly. What's on the left?
- Where? Oh, it's nothing. "Trumpet." It's far away, don't worry. Look, there's a Night Star glowing over there. There's always some distance from the artifact to the mother anomaly. Fifty meters from us to the "Star", it means that it is at least the same distance to the "Skirpin". Listen, Old One, wait a second, I'll bring up the "Star".
- Scout, settle down!
- For the last time! It's good for you, the general gives you all the money you want. I make my own bonuses. You're sorry?
- That's not why we came here.
- I understand, but you also understand, you can't find such serious artifacts anywhere else. Do you know how much I get for them? Ten times what you'd get for a piece of trinket. You can count as much as I get for the Jokers!
- One last time," Andrei surrendered. - With a bullet.
Stalker happily hummed and ran a course on a greenish glow artifact.
- Scout, stop! - A distant whisper came from far away. - Get back!
Andrew turned at the voice, but a new sound forced him back to his original position. The sound came from Scout. He shrieked, flew up a couple of meters, and disappeared into the pitch blackness. Peepers tried their best, but Andrew could not see where the hapless stalker was knocked out by the insidious "Trumpet". The impact of the anomaly was strong enough to throw Scout a hundred meters. Or smear it on some obstacle closer than a hundred metres.
Lunev set the night vision sensitivity to maximum and got a glimpse of something. Scout was rummaging in the dirt almost in the middle of the field, with signs of powerful anomalies to his left and right. Another anomaly lurked just beyond where the stalker had fallen. Scout was clearly out of it, but probably in one piece - his arms and legs were weak, but not hanging by a whip, and his head occasionally fell to his chest, but rose again and again.
After about half a minute the stalker got over the knockdown and tried to rise to his feet. This he succeeded easily enough, only not because he finally came to his senses. He had been helped. Somehow, unnoticed, several figures in dimensionless robes appeared around the stalker. Creatures easily took away Scout weapons, firmly grasped him under his arms and dragged, skillfully maneuvering between anomalies, to the opposite edge of the field.
- Bloody hell! - Andrey grabbed his gun and even took a step towards the field, but in time he came to his senses.
Rushing to help Scout was pointless. Firstly, Andrew would never be able to so cleverly pass the anomalies, and secondly, he would be too late anyway. The enemies disappeared into the darkness in just a minute. Where to look for them there, only God knew. And that was unlikely.
"And the controller, who is still lurking in our footsteps, might also know."
Andrey lowered Tatiana to the ground, turned to face the south and defiantly put the gun on the bend of his elbow. With all his appearance Lunev tried to show that he wanted to clarify relations with an uninvited ally here and now.
- What are you up to? - Tatiana whispered.
- You will see.
- If she does not want to go with us there must be a reason. Why should she be forced?
- Her? - Andrew looked at his companion with surprise.
- Well, yes," Tatiana replied with the same surprised look, "Olga.
- Do you think it is her?
- Didn't you hear her voice?
- He heard it, but he didn't recognize it," I heard from the darkness. - 'I wanted to.
Something in Lunev's mind was switched on, and a completely unfamiliar, moreover, a sexless voice suddenly found familiar intonations. Now Andrei recognized it perfectly. It really was Olga's voice.
- I did not understand. - Lunev frowned at the girl who had appeared out of the shadows. - What kind of tricks?
- I do not know myself. - Olga sighed. - It just happens.
- How long has it been?
- Since I got up the hill, and then it started. I was still on the other side. At first I thought I was going crazy, then I thought I was turning into a controller. Now I just don't think about anything, I just do what I can.
- Mechanic... is that your job?
- It's my job. Plus, I took care of another controller who was leading the mercenaries.
- Who was in charge of the dead guys?
- He went into the sector right after you did. You didn't notice?
- Somehow, no. He's a slick one. But you went too far with the Mechanic.
- What else was there to do?! I just still don't know how to put a lifted zombie back down. I honestly would have put him down if I could! Not a soulless creature... even though I have these controlling tricks now. I honestly tried to calm him down, but I couldn't.
- And no one can, that's the trouble," said Andrew, still sullenly. - If anything, don't bring me up, agreed?
- Yes. - Olga hesitated. - What are you talking about? Bite your tongue!
- Don't make such wishes. - Andrew grinned unhappily. - Just in case.
- Don't make a witch out of me at all, okay? - Olga spoke angrily. - If we hadn't come to this sector, I would still have my own interests.
- Exactly! - Suddenly snapping his fingers, said Andrew. - Bull's-eye! It just occurred to me!
- What do you mean? - Olga asked Olga a little scared.
- Don't ask yet, I can't give a clear answer anyway. - Lunev waved his hand. - Can't you read minds?
- No.
- Well, why did you fail so badly? - Andrew ironically looked at the girl.
- But I can feel the path!" Olga assured me, not catching the irony. - It is here too, only it leads ... Not as it was with us - from the Zone to the gates of the hidden sector, but from the gates to some special place, like the centre of the local anomalous energy, you see?
- No, but I think that's where we're going, - said Andrew. - "One thing confuses me. Why the inspectors have left us alone all of a sudden? Did you frighten them away, or did they do it on purpose?
- They took Scout," Olga protested.
- He flew himself to them.
- Then I don't know.
- And on second thoughts? You should be able to see what they were thinking by now, I don't know.
- I don't know, honestly! Maybe they're trying to trap us.
- I don't need you to figure that out. Why, that's the question! Why the controllers want you is understandable: to re-educate you, to send you back as a spy... classic genre. But what the hell do they need us for? Me, Tatiana, Scout... After all, from the point of view of the locals, we - talentless, walking cutlets, nothing more.
Olga silently threw up her hands.
- 'And I'm interested in another thing,' said Tatiana. - Did General Ostapenko know or not what would happen when we enter the Thirteenth Sector?
- Suppose he guessed, so what? - Andrei looked at his companion with interest.
- Nothing in particular. - Tatiana marked a tired smile. - Well, except that I personally feel set on a hook worm. And what's the most frustrating - no matter how much you wriggle, the end has actually come.
- Fish and bait, - quietly remarked Andrew.
- Does it help us? Whether the general catches his fish or not, we'll all the same... go to waste. That is what they say here, isn't it?
- Not among us, among military men, but they say so, that's right. - Andrew met Olga and with a nod ordered her to take the place of conductor. And he again turned to Tatiana. - How are your legs?
- Already not hurts. - Tatiana tiredly sighed. - And if they hurt... Why a worm legs?</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a8_doc_8">
    <text>The creeping dusk, the thickening clouds and the heavy smoke turned the citadel into a glowing island in the middle of a dark sea of impenetrable fog. And beneath the smoky surface of the notional sea were many monsters, to whom all sharks, octopuses and sea serpents were no match, or rather, keratinized growths on their muddy heels.
On the one hand the task of the defenders of the warehouse complex had become more difficult, on the other hand it was almost the same. With full illumination the work was also carried out mainly in squares, and also almost without pause; the incessant rumble of explosions made the men almost deafening. Still, the approaching night seriously worried the men and commanders in D-3. Should they break through or be boarded again, the mutants could prowl the darkest corners of the citadel and cause considerable damage afterward by organizing sabotage raids behind enemy lines. The power of autonomous generators could not be simply enough for all the searchlights and "cobras" perimeter defense, plus the lighting of the interior territory, and night vision devices (incidentally, the smoke is not very effective) were available to special forces and only every other "cleaner".
After the revision of "special" stock of the head of the warehouse complex of NV equipment were found for all soldiers and for the strike team of stalkers, but still they were not enough. At night, all who could hold a weapon should have been able to see.
But every cloud has a silver lining. The same audit had also helped find provisions for almost a thousand American phosphorus grenades, as well as two ancient but never fired heavy infantry flame throwers, ten one-gallon canisters of pre-prepared napalm, and several bags of propellant powder. Officially all this was considered obsolete, decommissioned and ready for write-off, but in fact it was perfectly serviceable and ready for use for its intended purpose.
Bibik, at first shaking his pistol in front of the warehouse major's nose, seeing this wealth, cooled down a little and even promised the thieving rearman to replace the shooting with sending him to the loophole as a private.
- But be warned, you cheapskate, I'll remember everything! - The colonel finished his fiery speech. - The fact that you sold flame-retardant material for the LPO, and most importantly, that you lied as if you didn't have anything else of the kind! Don't you understand that lives are at stake? Money doesn't matter!
- Well... I'm not a chemist! - The major mumbled, pale and covered in cold sweat again. - I didn't know you could use flamethrowers... I thought it was a different mixture! And these... TPOH... I thought they weren't working. They're older than Pop's dog, they've been written off since the Soviets! And the napalm... I thought they stuffed bombs with it, I thought it wouldn't work in barrels.
- I'll make you roll one of these barrels out of the gate, open it, tip it over and set it on fire, and then we'll see what this jelly is good for! - Bibik swung his pistol as if he were going to brand the major's forehead with it.
- Can you do that? - The major pulled his head in his shoulders in fright. - I did not know, I am a rear man!
- And grenades?! Don't you know anything about that either? Answer me, you warehousing bastard!
- I do. But they've been banned...
- They're old too, aren't they? Labeled 2005, what's the expiry date, like kefir? Is the phosphorus inside sour?
- No, but... I've got a decommissioning order! The M.I.S.A.'s Deputy Armaments Director personally signed it. "Due to the danger of storage and use..."
- Why did you keep them? Why didn't you send them to the right place? You better shut up, you bastard! Get out of here! Private!
- ß... - The major hesitated. - I'm an officer... you can't just... like this.
- Should I call the general to demote you? Or should I rip your head off and blame it on mutants?
- Yes, Private.
Demoted warehouseman sighed and rushed to help the fighters in clearing the basement from the requisitioned ammunition. Pashkov, who was present at the reprimand, which Bibik arranged for the "warehouse crooks", immediately appointed the major as a squad leader of one of the two almost museum-quality infantry flamethrowers "TPO-50. The lieutenant ordered one gun to be mounted on the most dangerous western direction, while the other was dragged by fighters onto the roof of the northern warehouse. Five light flamethrowers were evenly distributed throughout the rest of the depots except for the southern one. Bibik didn't hold on to the grenades either, ordering three of each to be distributed to all fighters on the walls.
- Grenades are good, Pashkov said, but flamethrowers... ...would be a pampering job. What is a ton of napalm? Heavy ones use twenty litres per shot, light ones only three, but their effect is... not so good. We can beat off three attacks, no more. And it's hard to reload. There's only one compressor, no spare cylinders, it takes a while to recharge... These flamethrowers are a thing of the past. I wish we had a hundred Bumblebees in here.
- Where can we get them? But we'll give the beast a light even with ancient weapons, Pashkov, don't worry. Ready mixture we'll fill in all around, and meanwhile we'll prepare a new one and pump it into cylinders as tanks are emptied. We'll make it all in time. If we don't, we'll use grenades to prolong the pleasure.
- Napalm and phosphorus grenades will make the smoke...
- Isn't there a lot of smoke around now? You can't breathe without a mask, even in basements.
- This one's different. Napalm smoke is black, dense and acrid, it's a dog's ass! And the phosphorus smoke is also poisonous, we can get sick, we can get poisoned.
- What do we need masks for? Everything will be fine, Pashkov. It's better to wear gas masks than without them, shooting at random in broad daylight. Wait till we run out of flame-retardant with grenades, we'll think of something else. We'll fill the place with bertolium salt and icing sugar and sprinkle sulphuric acid on top. It'll burn like napalm. We'll keep the ring of fire going as long as we can. It's the most effective tactic.
- We'd better not fry ourselves in this ring, - Pashkov grunted incredulously. - And where can you get so much of this... bertoolethal salt? And sulphuric acid.
- I am for example. - Bibik patted Pashkov on a shoulder. - Work on it, Lieutenant. One more thing... Don't pour too much at the southwest gate and leave a hundred grenades for emergencies.
- Another breach? - The lieutenant looked at Bibik inquisitively.
- We'll see there.
The colonel grabbed a phosphorus grenade and made his way out of the "secret stash" into the fresh air. It wasn't as smoky in the courtyard of the citadel as outside the warehouse complex, but it was almost impossible to breathe without a mask. Bibik had a pretty clear idea of what would start here once the citadel was in a ring of fire, but he saw no other way out. About the breakthrough the question was not solved yet. The general had been trying to prove to his staff for about three hours that a bombing plan would not work, but it was unclear how the debate would end. On the contrary, everything was clear about the new attempts to storm the city - they would happen and they would have to be repelled regardless of the prospects. Even if Ostapenko fails to defend his point of view and the D-3 garrison will have to break through, some time will be taken to prepare the operation, that is, one or two assaults must be withstood, whatever one may think.
There was a light haze even in the headquarters bunker, the colonel was not exaggerating in his conversation with Pashkov. The exhaust ventilator was working hard, but the front door was hardly closed, and the smoke entered the room much faster than it escaped. Bibik's appearance on the doorstep coincided with the General's outburst of indignation over the matter. The colonel suspected that his superiors were irritated not at all by the throat- tickling smoke but by the unresolvable contradictions with the staff, but he vented his anger on his subordinates, masking the real reasons with discontent over the smoke.
- Will this walking ever end, or not?! Why are you running here and there like shuttles, letting in smoke? There's nothing to breathe!
- I'm Shuttlecraft 1, permission to land? - Beebeek tried to lighten the mood.
- Go in and close the door. - Ostapenko waved his hand. - Sargeant!
- ß! - From the adjoining room the communicator looked out.
- Go out, take over the guard at that side. Wrap everybody up till the colonel comes out. Understood?
- Yes, sir!
- At least it'll get some air," grumbled the general, turning the hood on to maximum. - It doesn't pull at all!
- The voltage is low," sympathized Bibik. - "The lights are taking too much of it and the cobras are all ablaze all around us. I've ordered the internal power grid to be switched over to the standby power. On a residual basis.
- Electrician! - Ostapenko glanced irritably at the colonel. - Don't you have nothing else to do?
- Why not? I also opened a secret warehouse, a ton of napalm, flamethrowers, and a thousand phosphorus grenades. So now we live. At least we can hold out till tomorrow night. I mean... we can hold out.
- Good news, - Ostapenko concluded without the slightest hint on joy. - AND THE UAVS? I thought you were looking for them.
- We found them, too. The major has another warehouse under the warehouses, it has everything, like in Greece. And it's all written off. Klondike!
- Who would have doubted it. - Ostapenko nodded. - The night vision gadgets will come in handy soon. You confiscated everything?
- Every last one. Only you're counting on them for nothing. They don't work well in smoke.
- Now there's smoke, two hours later it's gone... - The general hesitated for a second. - In a clear field, the wind will blow it away quickly. It's not working, Bibik, with headquarters. Stubborn as sheep! Break through, that's all the talk. I tell them about probable losses, they tell me about the general situation. As if I don't know what's going on in the whole Borderland, and I can't assess the complexity of our situation. I mean their situation. The entire Zone containment system is under threat.
- The whole thing? - Bibik shook his head incredulously. - How many more breakout points have been set up besides ours?
- Eleven more," the General answered grimly. - And all of them are spouting. At least HQ admits it, we're doing more or less well. I mean, we are useful and if it weren't for the failures at the other points, no one would tug at us. But the trouble is that no one is fighting on other fronts for a long time now. Enthusiasts like us were found only in Bragin. But an hour ago it was over there too. We're the only ones who are holding out. Anyway, it's settled. We'll figure out how to get out with as little loss as possible.
- I have thought of this question just in case, - Bibik reported with a sigh. - There's no sense to break through to Andreyevka for the second time. We must try the southwest route. First go along the canal to Stepanivka, then as if to Priborsk, but in fact just over the bridge to the right, descend down the Hoceva to Teterev and take a dash to the other side through the ford Homichiv.
- Difficult route.
- But reliable. From the west, there will be forest all the time - we will put the fire to cover it, and from the east, first the canal, then the river, the bog and the road. We'll be able to see every creature a mile away. We'll slip between the fire and the water.
- We need to think. - Ostapenko unbuttoned his collar and rubbed his neck. - My throat is torn from the smoke, I have no strength.
- Well, that can be solved. - Bibik took a flask out of his pocket. - Take a sip. Five stars. Any irritation's as good as gone.
- I don't drink, Beaker.
- I'm not offering you a drink, just take a sip.
- Come on," the general surrendered. - Did you get through to Old Man by any chance?
He took a sip, grimaced and returned the flask to the colonel.
- I don't know," confessed Bibik. - The connection seemed to be established, he answered something indecipherable, I started dictating instructions and then everything went out and that was the end of it.
- Where are they now, have you not had time to find out?
- I told you... - Bibik shook his head. - No, I did not have time to find out.
The colonel as if by chance also took a flask more thoroughly than Ostapenko.
- So, we do not count on Old, - concluded the general. - So be it. Start preparing for the operation. I'll join you soon. And look, Colonel, everything must be taken into account down to the last detail. There won't be a third attempt, we're not holding a weightlifting championship.
- We'll do everything to the best of our ability," Bibik said enthusiastically. - We'll make such fireworks, the animals will remember it all their lives. And we'll walk down the fire corridor ourselves.
- You're an optimist, Bibik.
- That's what it is. - The colonel took the flask out of his pocket again, but immediately hid it. - You'll need it again. Here's to victory.
Ostapenko opened his mouth to make some remark about another optimistic phrase of his subordinate, but did not have time: his retort was preceded by a phone call. The general pressed the answer button, listened to a short message and, without answering anything, turned off the communicator.
Seeing the expression on the commander's face, Bibik stood up abruptly and pulled on his uniform.
- Leaving?
- Yes," Ostapenko muttered through gritted teeth. - Immediately. HQ is bringing up the stormtroopers. There will be heavy ammunition on the suspensions.
- Are the stakes rising?
- The thirteenth infiltration point has formed in the Dymer. The first outside the Borderlands. No nastiness has come out of it so far, but the command does not intend to wait for this "lucky" moment. Belarusian "Grads" will be directed against northern objects, assault helicopters against western objects, and it was decided to process the east and south - the most saturated areas with mutants - with thermobaric ammunition.
- I've had enough of that," sighed Bibik once again. - Do you have at least one hour to spare?
- No more than.
- Then it is bearable yet. We'll get through, General. It's not the first time.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a8_doc_9">
    <text>Two things were the hardest to get used to: the light and the darkness. They weren't the same in the sector as in the outside world. It would seem that what could be unusual about visible radiation, or the lack thereof? The thirteenth sector easily proved - many things. As in the outside world, starlight could barely penetrate the cloud cover, but if there was a gap in the clouds, the area beneath it was flooded with a sparkling glow, more like a sparkling fog. It was as bright as daylight, but visibility was not improved. A veil of glittering billions of glitter blinded me, making it impossible to see even the closest objects. Once, when caught in such fog, the walkers nearly broke their legs. Good thing that Olga got her bearings in time and forced her comrades to stop literally at the edge of a deep ravine. When the clouds closed the dark canopy again, the darkness was so thick that the night vision equipment could not cope even with the light turned on. They had to rely again on detector readings, hearing, smell and intuition.
The instruments, incidentally, were of little help either. The Thirteenth's electronics worked poorly at all. Communicators were silent, directional imagers were nearly blind, and motion, anomaly, and heat detectors of all kinds lied miserably. Three times the anomaly detectors raised an alarm was false, and motion detectors were triggered every ten seconds for no apparent reason. However, with such a play of light and darkness, the expression "apparent reasons" lost all meaning. It was possible that some of the locals might have crossed the path of the walkers, but they could neither see nor hear them.
There was also something wrong with the sounds in the sector. The constant background noise was created by the wind fluttering the bare branches of young trees and shrubs. These sounds were not unlike those in the outside world. But besides the noise of the wind, the Thirteenth was rich with many other sounds: from the chilling howls, wild laughter, and growls of unknown creatures to the loud creaking and grinding that came from the interwoven branches of the old trees. Footsteps, the slurping of mud, and even gunshots were lost in such a soundtrack, as in a silencer.
The shots, however, were almost silent as it was only Andrei who was firing. Neither Olga nor Tatiana used weapons. Olga had enough troubles on the trail, after the ravine she focused exclusively on the role of a guide. And Tatiana fiddled with the instruments and convince her that survival in the sector is more important than his study is not possible. And Andrei didn't try. To cover the shrunken group he could do it alone. Tatiana had gone headlong into what she loved, and that was the most sensible option. Distracted from the eerie reality around her, she did not panic and did not interfere with the pace at which the situation allowed. The only thing that did not suit Andrei was Tatiana's constant striving to get off the trail. But this problem was solved simply - Old tied the lady with a rope, mandatory for every walker, to his belt. Another leash was fastened on Olga's belt. A tether could interfere in an emergency situation, but the risk was justified; without a tether it was unreal to stay together.
To be honest, the further the group moved along the trail, the less Andrei believed that an emergency situation would arise. The trail led through strange places, around raging anomalies and rampaging thousands of mutants, but from the anomalies of the walkers securely covered "Jokers" (in a hidden sector, they seem to have become even stronger), but the mutants around only growled and sliced circles. Whether the artifacts were scaring them off or whether there were other reasons, it was unknown. Andrei suspected that Olga had some merit in this. Not that the mutants treated her with reverence, but they were clearly afraid of her. Although it could be more complicated than that. For example, if the relatively peaceful journey along the inner path was provided by whoever was running this whole sector. Either way, it was clearly not gunfire that kept the monsters at bay.
When to the right of the trail stopped moaning and grunting of the century-old oaks, Olga pulled the rope and stopped. Tatiana did not understand the conventional signal and, swooping, almost knocked her guide to the ground. Good thing that both managed to support Andrew.
- The road went down, - said Olga. - Down there, there will be something like a river. Only it looks like... like lava. If we are not frightened, we will pass.
- I will not be frightened. - Tatiana got the hint right. - Will it be an illusion again?
- No, it will be lava. - Olga pointed ahead. - Look closely, do you see the purple glow? It is just above this river rising.
- Ah... how come... we won't burn? Why not?
- Because we're going over the bridge. There's not much left of it, we'll have to jump through the holes, but we can walk. The main thing is to have courage. Andrei, do you remember what was in the underground city? It is the reflection of the cleft in the sector.
- It turns out, if to project this place on an external world, we somewhere in Pripyat?
- In the area of the bus station, - Olga said confidently.
- How do you know all this?
- 'I have no idea. When I entered this sector, it was as if something switched in my head. I know a lot about him now. Both about him and about the Zone in general.
- What about why we came here?
- No, I do not know that. Ask Ostapenko.
- I'd only ask where to get him. We'll have to figure it out ourselves, so help us find the answers.
- Ask, I'll help if I can.
- I wish I knew what to ask!
- I thought you said it hit you. Didn't you?
- It's still the same. It's all questions. For instance, why did you bring us here, why did your master want our group?
- Who?" Olga stared at the Old Man in surprise. - Have you decided to play Scout? You want to blame it all on me? It won't work, Old One. It won't work! Ostapenko sent us here, the Mechanic brought us here. I don't even know about the master. Why do you suddenly think there's a master in the sector?
- Isn't there? - Andrew tried to catch Olga's gaze, but it was impossible to play staring in the dark. - You know everything about this sector now. So tell me, who is the boss here?
- I don't know anything about any boss!
- And Ostapenko believes that all of the recent events, from the Zov, which assembled mutants to modify and humans to transform, to the current attack from the hidden sector, are all part of the Master Enemy's grand plan. A plan for expansion under the cover of the Zone.
- Great! - Olga laughed. - Isn't Ostapenko's data too precise? Could it be that these are parts of HIS plan?
- I don't get it. - Andrei frowned. - What are you implying?
- Nothing! - Olga grinned vindictively. - You figure it out yourself, you are so smart.
- Excuse me, Tatiana interjected, but could we ... Leave it alone. For the time being. I have a bad feeling about this.
- Me too," Olga agreed. - Let's go to the river. It will become clearer on the other bank. The trail ends half a kilometre from the bridge, in some ruins.
- In the centre of Pripyat? - specified Andrew.
- Something like that. To the left, where the pool is.
- It's a bad spot. - The old man thought about it. - There's no trouble in the regular Zone, either. Monolith territory.
- I could be wrong," Olga warned him.
- 'Monolith? - Tatiana inquired. - Is it kept there? That magic crystal, which supposedly created the Zone?
- Allegedly, - stressed Andrei. - No one has ever seen this crystal. Not even the Monoliths themselves. But the energy in that place is crazy, that is true. Maybe, there is a connection with what is located here at the end of the path? Olga, what do you think?
- We shall see. - The girl shrugged her shoulders. - There's anomalous energy all over the place. Can't you feel it?
- Thanks to the Jokers, not really.
- It's all ahead of us, then. You'll feel it at the end of the trail, and the Jokers won't help. I'm sensing a powerful energy source. It's out there in the ruins. We might as well see who really sent us here.
- Don't try to twist it," said Andrei sternly. - We shall not meet Ostapenko in your ruins. At least because the general is in D-3 now, that's for sure.
- That does not mean anything," said Olga. - From the Thirteenth if you want, you can get anywhere, you've already made sure, just need to correctly open the transition point. The source of the anomalous energy must be the means by which such points are opened.
- No, you're still wrong. In Borderlands, only points of exit from the sector can be opened, not entering it," Andrei argued, not too confidently.
- Right, to prevent the enemy from retaliating. But your Enemy in Chief could have left a simple loophole for himself. What reason would he have to stay in the outside world, if something suddenly goes wrong? Makes sense?
- We'll see," said Andrew in the same tone as Olga a moment ago. - Lead on.
The river of fire, promised by Olga, was not as frightening as Lunev had imagined. The blazing barrier was rather narrow and the dark red lava in its bed was barely smoldering, heating the air to seventy degrees, no more. Of course, it is not pleasant, but even poorly prepared Tatiana could endure such "frying". And what Olga called a bridge turned out to be just a skeleton of such a construction. Walking across the narrow stone beams thrown across the lava river was real only if one used nerves of steel as imaginary railings. Or would use one's sanity as a balancing pole.
- Coming through? - Andrei turned first to Tatiana.
- A weak link, huh? - Tatiana smiled wearily. - I will pass. As a child did acrobatics, I have a good balance.
- I thought so, too. - Olga glanced at the Old One. - But for some time now I prefer not to hang out over rivers of fire. Though I love fire.
- That's all in the past," Andrei said. - If you fall again, I promise, I'll pull you right back. We're a team, after all. Do you want me to go first?
- No!" Olga wagged her finger at the Old Man. - I'll manage it!
She did manage it. The sight of the lazy scarlet river did not frighten Olga, neither did the heat and stench affect her sanity, and her guide's confidence seemed to be transmitted to the whole group. It was only in the middle of the narrow bridge, when suddenly a bright flash flashed at the surface of the river, that Olga froze for a moment, but, convinced that there was no danger, she moved on. A few more flashes and low fountains of sparks tried to confuse the walkers as the group was about to reach the bank. Andrew suspected that if the river had been hotter, the spitting of incandescent lava would have gone much higher. The walkers would have been in for a world of hurt. But now the fiery river looked sleepy and in no hurry to burn people.
- It's a lovely little stream," Andrew grinned as he stepped onto the bank. - If it didn't stink of hydrogen sulphide so that filters wouldn't help, we could make a picnic on the bank.
- I don't like it. - Olga rubbed her temple and looked round. - Something's about to happen, I can feel it in my ass.
- Young lady, what kind of language is that? - The old man grinned again. - You're in decent society. Now.
- Seriously, Old. - Olga turned her head restlessly. - Someone is watching us. And I don't like it. It's not the beast, it's someone else.
- A controller?
- Stronger. He's watching from afar, he can only see our silhouettes, but I can still feel his gaze.
- And after that you will say that we are not expected?
Olga answered something, but her words were drowned out by the rumble of the collapsing beams and piers of the bridge. Why the structure had suddenly collapsed, none of the walkers understood. It just stood there and then suddenly collapsed.
- So much for that," muttered Andrew, surprised to see the stone debris slowly sinking into the lava. - And if we were on the bridge?
- That's two," Olga said in tone with Old and pointed to the left, upstream of the fiery river. - Did a dam break somewhere?
Above, the river was boiling and spreading out on both banks in a wide stream of fire. And all this flaming mess was rushing towards the walkers.
- Footsteps! - Andrzej shouted softly. - Higher up!
- Just along the path. - Olga waved a hand to the north. - Further is a hill. There are ruins on it. In the ruins... a spring.
- "On a black-black hill stood a black-black house..." - Andrew remembered a child's frightening story. - Not a raid turns out, but a journey through the unconscious. Right, Tatiana Sergeyevna?
- What do you mean? - Tatiana removed frightened look from the rushing fire wave and incomprehensible look at Andrew. - I listened.
- Run, I said, do not slow down!" Old took her by the hand and pulled her along.
The light of the flooded river of fire finally provided a relatively normal visibility, and soon the walkers were able to see the ruins that Olga had promised them.
It was a sight to behold. On top of a small hill rose the ruins of a veritable medieval castle; with half-destroyed towers and walls of huge stones, the remains of tiled roofs over the buildings in the courtyard, and a distorted gate that had grown into the ground. The moat was missing, but the river of fire played its part well, so everything was in keeping with that plan. And instead of lightning ripping through the black clouds (which would have given the picture a fairy-tale look), there was a soft white glow over the ruins. Not too intense, but enough to illuminate the upper floors and the roof of the castle.
- There, waiting. - The old man pointed to a human figure on the roof. - Is he?
- How should I know? - Olga tried to look at the figure through the scope, but did not have time. - Gone somewhere.
- We'll sort it out," Andrei promised. - Entrance through the gate? What do you feel?
- It's locked, don't you see? There's an entrance through a breach in the wall to the right of the gate.
- Is that where the dogs are hiding? - Andrei, following Olga's example, also assessed the situation with the rifle scope. - Toothy ones.
- Cerbers. - Olga checked the magazine. - You can't take them with ordinary bullets.
- Cerbers? - Tatyana misunderstood. - What do you mean? With two heads? And what kind of bullets for them are needed, silver?
- Armor-piercing! - Snorting she explained Olga. - And they have one head. I mean one for each. Don't take it so literally.
- Sorry, it's the excitement. Everything looks very unusual, like in a fairy tale. A scary fairy tale. It's my first time in a place like this.
- It's everybody's first time. Quiet now, please. Old man, I'll go ahead and cover.
- No problem. But I don't think they'll hurt you.
- I know. I'm worried about you. I'll see if I can lock them up somewhere.
- You needn't worry," a sudden sound seemed to come from two metres above the walkers' heads.
Andrei and Olga, as if on cue, raised their weapons, but did not fire. There was nothing to shoot at. Theoretically, people in the sky should have seen a particularly intelligent "batman" or a controller seated in some exotic carriage pulled by flying creatures. But they didn't see anyone, although there was plenty of light on the slope. A river of fire lit up (and burnt thoroughly) from below, while an enigmatic white glow shone from above. Andrew was still inclined to probe the zenith with a couple of bursts, but he was stopped by Olga. She put her hand on the barrel of his 'shaft' and with her eyes pointed to the roof of the building, which was visible in the breach in the wall. Once again a dark figure loomed on the roof. It was difficult to believe that the voice belonged to this man, but Andrew decided to trust his companion's instincts and lowered his weapon.
- Is he speaking through a megaphone?
- I don't know. He hardly uses a mobile phone at all.
- And apart from jokes?
- How should I know? Ask him!
- I'll answer any questions," it sounded like it was coming out of the sky again. - Go on. The dogs won't hurt you.
- That's very kind of you. - The old one changed magazine and handed another to Olga. - "But the lard had better be re-hidden. These are armour-piercing. The last ones, mind you. Shall we go?
- Let's go! - Exhaled Olga.
Andrew grinned and nodded at Tatiana. She, as usual, did not even touch the weapon, only firmly clenched fists. Andrei pointed to her holster, but the lady shook her head.
- I am not a good shot. I'm not a good shot. I'm not a good shot, and I could shoot you, too. I'd better give it to you. If I have to.
- Then stay between us. Olga, let's go!
The Cerbers, indeed, did not touch the men. They only growled menacingly and lined a living corridor on either side of the breach in the wall. Two of the creatures met the group outside the castle, eight more inside. The dogs were like Rottweilers, but about the size of a year-old steer, with teeth like sharks, except in more than one row. They barked and spat and flanked them a couple of times as if they were going to pounce, but they didn't do anything. When the group had arrived at the last of the beasts they calmed down, even sitting on their short tails as if embarrassed to wag their tails. Or afraid to do so in full view of their master.
Olga suddenly stopped and fearlessly held out her hand to one of the dogs. Andrei froze, in full readiness to pierce the beast's hard skull with an armor-piercing round, but nothing of the sort was required. The dog settled down and condescendingly allowed the girl to pat its ears.
- I wonder if you can tickle a bloodsucker between the tentacles. - Andrzej gritted his teeth.
- There are no other creatures here, - replied Olga calmly. - There are some controllers hiding somewhere and... this one... with a megaphone.
- Ah, well, then, of course. - The old one hummed. - That's another matter, then. You can consider the castle clear.
- This way. - Olga stopped at the entrance to the building.
Milky white light poured from the doorway. Andrei knew, without any hint, that the walkers were this way. An invigorating wave of energy pulsed from the depths of the building beside the light. The air felt electrified. Electricity poured in, making every hairs tingle and pricking their skin with millions of invisible needles.
The walkers cautiously entered the building and stopped at the threshold. The interior of the room in which they found themselves was very simple. A stone like a barrel stood in the middle of the room, with cooking utensils and implements, thickly dusted and ashy on the far wall. Between the stone and the pile of junk, with his back to the guests, stood the owner. From the general outline, it was the same man whom the walkers had seen on the wall. It was difficult to say with any certainty. The outline was distorted by the white glow that enveloped the man. It blurred the outlines and made the figure of the host look like a large tongue of wavering flame, black in the centre and white at the edge. The sight was breathtaking, even hypnotic. It took a serious mental effort on Andrei's part to break through the obsession and, raising his assault rifle to his shoulder for insurance, take at least one more step forward.
Feeling or hearing that Old had broken out of his stupor, the castle master grinned and put his palm to his chest. The glow became less intense. The master slowly turned and looked around at the walkers.
The creature's pale face showed little or no emotion, and in its whiteless black eyes no thought or emotion could be read, yet its master had given himself away. Andrew almost immediately realized which of the three guests was of more interest to this peculiar controller than the others. The enemy glanced at Tatiana's face, held his gaze for a few long seconds on Old and fixed it on Olga.
Andrei slowly lowered his weapon and looked briefly at Olga. She stood as if a statue, not moving, not even breathing, and stared at the controller without looking away. No, she had not succumbed to his hypnosis. She stared wide-eyed, her gaze fixed, but a thought glowed in it. It was as if she recognized the creature and was now trying to figure out whether it was a game of imagination or really a memory clue.
Andrei's shoulder was touched by Tatiana. She inconspicuously moved close to him and now Andrey could see her with his side vision. With a barely perceptible movement of her head Tatiana pointed at Olga and then at the inspector. At first Andrey did not understand what his companion was trying to tell him.
Then he suddenly felt as if he had been doused with cold water.
Despite an unhealthy complexion and creepy eyes this creature had a marked portrait resemblance to Olga. Just like a sibling. Or father.
"What a son of a bitch, Ostapenko! - thought Andrei. - He's found the enemy after all! And he said he didn't know anything but naked theory. Yes, he does! Not only does he know the whole situation, but he can twist it as he likes. My hat's off to him if I get out. But first I'll give him a sniff, so that he'll finally understand, General, that people aren't pawns or creatures from the Zone. You can't play with them like that, hard and blind. Even if they have dubious relatives!"
- Hello, daughter," said the Controller softly. - 'It is good to see you. I had no doubt you would make it. After all, you have such good genes.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a9_doc_7">
    <text>To put it mildly, Olga felt lousy. As if she'd been stuffed alive into a coffin. As long as the monster remained silent, there was still a chance to explain to the unknown tormentors that a mistake had been made. But the Controller's words were thick nails hammered into the coffin lid. Now there was no chance left. No chance at all. It was a terrible shame. It hurt and bitter.
Such a powerful shock immobilized Olga more effectively than any suggestion. Everything that suddenly fell on her was as unbearable as a building slab. It fell straight onto Olga, crushed her, and now it was pointless to flutter about. Neither Olga herself, nor anyone else. She could not get out from under it on her own, and the others should have thought carefully whether it was necessary to pull her out, as in the cases of those zombies. Wouldn't it make more sense just to scratch the years of her life and her surname right on the slab?
The burning resentment that had spread inside gradually disappeared, giving way to an icy emptiness that froze her soul and thoughts. Now Olga felt like a mammoth in the permafrost. Or a creature in a grotto of an underground city, one of those whose contours were showing through the icy walls. Olga saw everything going on around her, heard the words, but did not understand their meaning. The world around her became something distant and unreal. Neither her touches nor her remarks were able to snap her out of her icy captivity. Both the inspector and Old tried in vain to rouse her. From now on, Olga did not care how this damned raid would end, who would win the unprecedented war, who would get the outer Zone and the whole world. Nothing else existed for Olga but the icy emptiness in which she was destined to remain forever...

...The pause was clearly dragging on. Olga said nothing to the controller as she drifted deep into herself. Andrew waited as long as he could and finally decided to take the initiative.
- Are you, papa, by any chance mistaken?
- You can see I'm not. - The Controller turned an otherworldly gaze on Lunev. - It's not easy for Ola now, but it'll pass. Do you have any objections?
- Objections to what? - Andrei grinned. - Against your family reuniting? No, I have no objections. Only one question: are you sure she wants it?
- She wouldn't have come here otherwise.
- You don't quite seem to know what she's here for, pops.
- I know everything, mercenary. Ostapenko sent you. He didn't tell Olga what for. He didn't tell you either, did he?
- I figured it out myself. - Andrei pointed the machine gun at the controller's stomach. - To give you an ultimatum. You're the one running things, aren't you?
- That depends. - He showed no emotion on his face, but a sneer rang in his voice. - What do you think?
- I'm thinking of killing you as a precaution before I find out what you've been up to.
- Are you sure a gun will do you any good? - The controller shifted his gaze to the assault rifle, and the gun suddenly unhooked the magazine 'by itself'.
The trick impressed, but did not frighten. True, it did not frighten only the Old One. Andrew felt Tatiana pressed against his back. He lowered his gun and slightly inclined his head to the side, looking at the controller.
- Well, you're not too sure of yourself either, papa," said Lunev. - Why not?
- You're wrong, mercenary," he replied quietly. - And stop calling me papa. I am the Engineer.
- I am the Old One. - Andrew nodded. - Now we have met. Shall we talk while we're at it? You can guess the text of my ultimatum. I won't give it to you.
- Then what do you want to talk about?
- Anything. The vicissitudes of fate, the meaning of life... lots of things. I'm very inquisitive. So are you. Otherwise you wouldn't have let us in here.
- I'm only interested in her. - The controller pointed at Olga. - You can leave, I'm not holding you.
- No, she won't. - Andrew, without looking, held hastily stepped back Tatiana. - Came in threes, we'll leave in threes. But while Olga is not ready, we have to fill the pause.
- She will not go with you. She belongs here.
- The dialogue doesn't work. - Andrei grinned. - Shall we have a duel?
- You will lose.
- Oh, I doubt it. If you could kill me, you would have done it long ago. But you're wasting your time talking, so something's bothering you. Maybe this?
Andrei pulled the Joker out from behind his groove. The engineer reacted almost nothing. Almost. There was a millimetre of movement backwards after all, and that fact did not escape Lunev's attention. He stepped toward the mutant and defiantly tossed aside the machine gun. The engineer lowered the hand clasped to his chest, and the room once again illuminated with a milky white glow. In its glow, the Joker suddenly began to glow too, but purplish red. This glow enveloped Andrei and began to spread across the dirt floor, gradually pushing the moon milk to the periphery of the hall.
Lunev couldn't see it, but the purple glow enveloped both Tatiana and Olga. The three red spots around the walkers grew slowly but steadily. A minute or two and the red glow could wrest a significant portion of the room from the white, at least a third of it.
- Get back! - ordered the Engineer. - If our artifacts come into contact, it could be catastrophic.
- Would it be the first time? - Andrei grinned again. - For the Zone disasters are like spring floods, a familiar situation.
- We will die!
- It is not the first time either. What are you afraid of? You died a long time ago. When you became a creature, you died as a man. Now you'll die like a creature. Who knows, maybe you'll turn into something more decent? A rat, for instance, or a toad.
- Don't talk nonsense, Old One, stop. - The Controller threw up his hand and tried to stop Andrei with his telekinesis.
Lunev was prepared for such a turn. He certainly felt the pressure, as if pound weights were hanging on his legs, but such an obstacle could not stop him. Andrei pulled himself together and took a few more steps forward.
- This is not a machine gun. - Lunev drew his shiv from its sheath. - Lay off, or I'll hurt you.
- All right. - The engineer lowered his hand. - What do you want? You won't just walk away, not even with Olga. Am I right?
- Right. I want answers. You promised. Then keep your promise. What were the Kazakiewicz labs for?
- Started from afar. - The engineer grinned and was quiet for a while. - All right. I'll answer. They were used to inoculate people with abnormal abilities. Without altering their appearance. Does that mean anything to you?
- No dumber than creatures like you. So they're creating latent mutants. Like a fifth column. And for what? For a full-scale expansion into the mainland? But why hidden ones and not people like you?
- People with the prerequisites of the mutants can live outside the Zone, but such as he - no, - whispered Tatiana.
- She is right, - agreed the Engineer. - Clever woman. You are lucky, mercenary.
- No compliments coming out of your mouth," the Old One cut off. - Why do you want the Black Angel?
- That's the easy part. The Zone is too inert to expand at the rate I want. I have found an alternative. The black angel could spread its tentacles hundreds of miles around in a matter of weeks.
- The Black Angel was the disease of the Zone, it was killing it.
- I know that now, but back then, he looked like a lucky find. Besides, he couldn't extend his tentacles here into the hidden sector. So, with the destruction of the outer territories, the Zone wouldn't die and would gradually regain its hold.
- You are too calm, Engineer," Andrei changed the subject abruptly.
He took another step towards the monster.
- Stay where you are, Old One, we're having a conversation. Why should I care?
- Your horde is fighting humans in the Borderlands and you're talking to me. Are you so sure your new campaign has been won? Why? What is the main focus of your new find? What are "spots of contact"?
- "Contact spots"? You could call them that. Through them, my troops can penetrate the outside world, straight to the mainland.
- And if there's a counterattack?
- It won't. You know what a diode is? The corridors work on the same principle, you can get out of this sector, but you can't get in. It's a precautionary measure. I've been experimenting with them for a long time. I wasn't very successful before: unstable corridors could be opened either inside or near the Zone. But gradually I've found a way to open them anywhere. You may have heard about the rings of green fog in Termahovka, Dymmer, Polessky, and even on the outskirts of Kiev. They were auras of exit points from the Thirteenth Sector.
- Through which new mutants entered the outside world, such as flying? But until then you used to test the new fighters of the future army only inside the Zone.
- That is correct.
- And you were not afraid that people would unravel your plan and invent weapons against new species? What were you hoping for? To crush them with mass?
- It worked. Right now, the creatures I've been listening to are eating your friends in the Borderlands and they'll be out of there in no time.
- Where they will die. - Andrew snapped his fingers. - You are lying, Engineer. Creatures can not live outside the Zone, you yourself have confirmed it. But you are still calm. Then there is another reason for that. What's that?
- You're smart enough for a human. - The engineer moved slowly to the right. - Well, I'll tell you the whole truth, you'll have no one to report it to anyway. The opening of the Contact Spots between this sector and the outside world will cause the anomalous energy of the Zone to surge from the Spots, essentially mini-zones, into the outside world at the time of the next Ejection. It will turn those who survive the metamorphosis into mutants. The rest will either die at once, or die a little later, wandering for a while as living corpses and rotting away.
- It's a fun prospect.
- That's how it was during the first Flash. - The engineer shrugged his shoulders. - It will be like that now. The sheer curvature of this sector, a hundred hectares of space could make a hundred jumps to any part of the planet. The only thing is to calculate correctly, so that the point of contact is not in some Uryupinsk, but in the centre of Kiev, Moscow, London and so on.
- And you can calculate it?
- Yes. Thermakhovka, Dymer and Polesskoye were a kind of triangulation and the outskirts of Kiev was a test shot, a check on the calculations made with the system I had developed.
- A swing from the heart, there was nothing to say. - Andrew measured the Engineer with a skeptical look. - Are you strong enough?
- Don't worry, Old One, I'll manage.
- I'm not worried. - Andrzej gripped his knife more comfortably. - Because you can't. I won't let you.
- Who do you think you are, little man?! - The mutant suddenly burst into flames. - Do you really think you can stop me?!
- Otherwise, why are you trying to talk some sense into me, Engineer? You're afraid to fight until help arrives!
The old one leapt to the left and blocked the Engineer's path to a secret door in the wall. The monster slowed down and tried again to stop the man with a telekinetic kick. Andrei lost his balance for a moment, but did not fall. Seizing the moment, he stepped forward sharply and stabbed. The blade slashed across the mutant's cheekbone, but not a drop of blood gushed from the thin cut. The engineer jumped to his left, about three meters away, and raised his arm again.
- For the last time, mercenary, stop. I have the gift of foresight. Our fight will end in disaster. Everyone in this room will die! If you do not value your own life, think of the life of your woman!
- I have! We won't be able to part peacefully, Engineer, even if you promise to forget about the outside world, close all corridors tightly and swear to live here quietly until the end of time. I'm not leaving here without your head!
- No, you idiot, I thought too much of you. - The engineer suddenly raised his hand to the ceiling and lowered it sharply.
A large piece of stone plummeted from the vault and landed on the floor one step from Andrew. If it hadn't been for the dirt floor, the shards of stone would have exploded in all directions as sharp shrapnel, thoroughly injuring the men, but nothing of the sort happened. The block of stone fell halfway into the ground, only shaking it perceptibly. Andrew again managed to keep his balance and attacked again.
What distinguishes jiu-jitsu from some other popular martial arts is that it not only contains techniques of counterattack with edged weapons, but also techniques of handling them. Andrei was equally proficient in both sections, and so his second attack reached its target. The knife entered deeply into the Engineer's neck, but again did no noticeable harm. The monster paid no attention to the wound at all. He bounced, now backwards, against the wall itself and made another hand pass. The kitchen utensils that had been dusting on the floor rose into the air.
Andrew quickly realized what was about to happen, and had time to shout, not turning around, but addressing his companions:
- On the floor!
Not only did he fall, but he also rolled back under the cover of a stone in the centre of the hall. A barrage of knives, forks, brass plates, jugs and heavy goblets whizzed by literally half a meter from the floor and collapsed with a thud against the wall with an entrance breach. Without waiting for the enemy to come up with another nasty idea, Andrei leaped out of hiding like a devil out of a box and charged at the Engineer. This time, apart from the knife, he had his Joker ready to fight. He clutched the artifact in his fist and prepared to do a 'double-take', first with the knife, then with his fist with the thing clutched in it.
This was clearly not to the engineer's taste. He suddenly tore off his cloak and used it, like a medieval swordsman, as a flexible shield and then as a weapon. The bundled fabric suddenly became unusually heavy and elastic and whipped at his hand with such force that Andrei dropped the knife. It felt like a strong blow from a rubber truncheon with a steel core.
The old man did not refuse to continue the attack and still pinned the Engineer to the wall, but with a direct kick of his foot. He had only to deliver a decisive punch to his opponent's chest - a large milky white crystal hanging on his chest - but at that moment a loud commotion was heard from behind Old, and then an unfamiliar voice called out to Andrei:
- Leave him alone, Old!
The first thought was: Olga had come out of her stupor and opted for her newfound daddy. The second: no, Olga was not so stupid and sentimental as to recognise this monster as her parent, she was well aware that it had long since ceased to be a man, but a creature in his skin. Third: The voice was high, but it did not belong to Olga. However, it was not Tatiana's either.
Andrew turned sharply and assessed the situation. Olga was being held tightly by three furies. Outwardly and in outfit they were similar to Engineer, only instead of white hedgehog hair on their heads flaunted fashionably disheveled. Otherwise, with their pale skin and black eyes, the ladies looked like sisters to the Engineer. At least from a distance. It was clear that Furies understood who the most dangerous of the guests after Andrew, and so took control of Olga, although the real need for this was not observed. The maiden was still in a daze and did not show any interest in what was happening. At first the choice of the Furies even surprised the Old One. Logically, to blackmail the Old Man, these sisters should block Tatiana, but they did not. Why - Andrew understood a fraction of a second later. The Furies had assigned this mission to another character.
The character smirked and one hand held Tatiana's waist, while the other put a knife to her throat. He was looking at the Old and the Engineer, and with the same smirk. As if to hint that in some way he had outplayed them both.
- Well, Mr. Engineer, did you see that I was right? You should have killed this team from the start, even under Opacichi! With machine guns. And you're all about telepathy, telekinesis... that's the end of the game.
- Scout? - Andrew felt the Engineer slipping away from the danger zone, but did not stop him. - What's with all the tricks?
- "Joker, drop it." - Scout shook his head, pointing to the far end of the hall. - Over there. The amulet, too.
As if to set an example, Scout sliced the strap with the artifact from Tatiana's neck and tossed it against the far wall. A second later, the Joker, which the Furies had removed from Olga's neck, flew there as well.
- I do not understand, stalker, you're going to the creatures?
- I was. - Scout grinned. - What, you don't believe me? Ask Olga. She almost had me. Bitch.
- Shut your mouth, asshole.
Olga woke up just in time. The old one assessed the new situation. The engineer prudently took a position at the secret door. Scout held Tatiana hostage, but whether he had the courage to kill his former companion in case of complications was still unclear. The three Furies surrounding Olga were dangerous as controllers, but unarmed. As for Olga herself, the question remained open. Logic dictated that she should stay on Andrei's side, but the same logic protested. Olga understood by vivid and lucid examples that she was inherently closer to the controllers than to humans, and so she could also take the side of the enemy. Such was the paradox. How the inner conflict would end, the proverbial logic did not know. Or rather, it told me too, but uncertainly. Fifty-fifty.
Needless to say, the situation was complicated. Andrew, of course, could try to drag things out somehow and try to move the problem to a new plane. But the pause could not be prolonged indefinitely, and there was no other way to translate it. Olga, the only variable that could change the balance of power, stubbornly stayed neutral.
Andrei dropped the Joker, followed by the amulet.
- They're all yours now, Master Engineer," Scout hummed.
- What a bastard you are," Tatiana said. - Get that iron away from my neck!
- Oh, be quiet, Tatiana Sergeyevna. - Scout grimaced. - I will not, you understand. Your beloved is too famous killer in the Zone to stay against him without a human shield.
- He's unarmed, isn't he?
- That's what you think. Hey, Engineer, he's all yours, what's the holdup?
- You're the one?" The engineer took a couple of steps, but not toward Lunev, toward the centre of the room. - You turned out to be a good psionic, I admit. Almost as good as my daughter.
- My what? - Scout marveled. - Olga? Oh, my God, the movie! How did you two find each other? Oh, I mean... I see... I wanted to ask you how you got lost. When?
- You will remember if you try, - said Olga suddenly, - Sasha...
- Right, the cinema. - Scout chuckled incredulously. - I didn't seem to introduce myself to you. How do you know my name?
- It was a few minutes before the Flash. Remember. The field trip, the bus, the three of us. Mum, me, and... Dad. You promised us it would be a cool trip.
- That's right! - Scout looked at the Engineer, then at Olga, then back at the Engineer. - And I wondered all the way up here how I knew you. What a life! Sometimes it gets so twisted that you can't think of anything. Turns out the Flash had mercy on you, too.
- That depends. - She put her hand on her assault rifle, but the Furies took it from her.
- 'Take it easy, sisters,' said the Engineer. - She is not dangerous. Yes, daughter?
- Don't call me that. - Olga glared coldly. - 'You are not my father. You're just a creature in his guise. And even then... a pathetic travesty. Yes, Scout, we were both caught in the Flash, but we got away with "just" a couple of internal abnormalities. We became covert controllers, and we can't get more than half a hundred kilometres out of the Zone. We're alive because the Zone keeps us alive. Almost like zombies, only in a lighter version.
- I know, I know. - Scout grimaced. - Not much good, I admit. The Cloaked Mutant is all right, bearable, but being trapped in the Zone for the rest of your life, not so much. That's why I decided to help your... this Engineer of yours. Contact spots around the world are our chance to stay in touch with the Zone wherever we go. Which means it's our real chance to live life to the fullest wherever we want. Ain't that right?
- No, Scout, it's not. We can't live life to the fullest, it's self-defeating.
- He's right, daughter, think hard,'' said the Engineer.
- Stop calling me daughter! - Olga burst out. - My father died six years ago!
Throughout this tense conversation Andrew was not so much listening as assessing the changes in the situation. Olga felt uncomfortable talking to these creatures, but she overpowered herself, trying to stall for time. Why, if not to pick her moment to attack? Surrounded by three controllers, resistance seemed pointless, but that was if Olga's abilities were not taken into account. For her, those half-dead ladies were no hindrance. She did not succumb to hypnosis, and with physical and combat training "daughter" was clearly better than the "sisters" Engineer. The master of the castle himself was far away and could not interfere with Olga or Andrei. It turned out that the weak link, as before, remained Tatiana.
"No problem," thought Andrei. - And Scout opened up. Very well."
Scout stared at Olga, seriously letting his guard down. There was no point in stalling any longer. Stealthily Andrey drew his second knife, hidden in his sleeve, and threw it without a swing, aiming at Scout's temple.
Everything could easily have been solved at this very moment, but the Thirteenth Sector wished to postpone the denouement. As if reading Andrei's thoughts, the "weakest link" decided to prove that it was in fact no different from the other "links". Well-balanced knife with engraved "NKVD" had barely gone in flight, when Tatiana suddenly threw back Scout's hand with a knife and hit the stalker hard in the groin. Scout gave a stifled cry and bent in half. In the same instant the knife whizzed over the stalker's head, but, contrary to Old's fears, it did not jingle against the stone wall, but found another target.
"Such a weapon cannot return to its sheath clean," the thought flashed. - Only it doesn't look like it's going to drink any hot blood today."
The Fink crunched through the bones and went deep into the eye of another Controller who had suddenly appeared behind Scout's back. Unlike the Engineer, this creature proved quite vulnerable. Dark, almost black blood splashed all over the Controller's face. The mutant froze for a second, then collapsed.
- A ghost! - One of the Furies shrieked. - The man has killed Ghost!
The engineer and all three sisters turned sharply on Andrei and delivered a powerful psi-strike. Lunev swayed, took a couple of steps backwards, but again did not fall over. In fact, on the contrary, he regrouped and, straightening up as a big, powerful spring, lunged straight at the Engineer. The controller, who hadn't expected such a speed from the psi-influenced man, didn't have time to get away and immediately paid for his sluggishness and arrogance. Andrei knocked him to the ground and threw him onto the altar. The engineer banged his head firmly against the edge of the stone and floated for a moment. Lunev tried to press his head to the stone with a kick, but missed. The mutant recovered rather quickly and managed to dodge.
- Yes, mercenary, you're strong! - The engineer jumped up and swung his cloak again, preventing another attack. - Even without the artifact you are strong. Ostapenko didn't rely on you for nothing. Not the artifacts, but you are the main Joker in the general's deck. But you are only human!
The monster threw up his arm again and unleashed a new psi-strike on the Old One, far stronger than any of the previous ones. Andrei understood perfectly well what the Engineer was hoping for. Without the Joker, any, even the strongest fighter was really just a man. Except there was one small but significant flaw in the Engineer's plan. He had apparently never heard the joke about appendicitis. "Doctor, my wife has appendicitis! - I removed your wife's appendix last summer, a man can't get a new one. - But a man can get a new wife!"
After Andrew spat on the psi influence and threw himself into a new attack, the Engineer suspected something of the sort, but it was too late. The old one gave him a real meat grinder. In the mercenary world, that's what they call a full-blown beatdown. If the Engineer had been a human or a mutant, not protected by a powerful artifact, death on the spot would have been guaranteed. But the Engineer, thanks to the support of the white crystal hidden in his sinus, again escaped with only bruises and a slight groggy condition.
Scout suddenly wheezed from the floor. He clearly was trying to give away Old's secret, to suggest that Andrew's sinus are also hidden "Joker" and the amulet Mechanic. But again Tatiana interfered in the matter. She finally decided to open the holster and remove the gun, but did not shoot, and only cracked Scout hard on the back of the head with the handle. For her zeal she immediately received a psi-strike from the sisters and collapsed unconscious on top of the stalker. But that didn't make things any easier for Scout. The blow to the back of his head also knocked him out cold, like a mere mortal, despite the fact that he was a psionic.
Unfortunately, still in all this dancing Olga did not participate, although it was obvious that the struggle of motives in her soul long ago ended, and in favor of people. Why she didn't at least tame the Furies, Andrei didn't understand. Something was holding Olga back. It was as if she was waiting to see how the confrontation between the Engineer and the Old One would end. As if she had decided for herself that the outcome of their duel would confirm or refute her conclusions.
Andrei, meanwhile, tried to confiscate the crystal from the Engineer, but failed. The monster came to its senses and began to fight back fiercely. It turned out that not only can it juggle objects with its talents, but also understands something about martial arts. The discovery came as a complete surprise to Andrei, but it soon dawned on the Old One that his opponent's transformation was simple. The engineer concentrated not on psi attacks but on active defense. Including anticipating events.
The new tactic was clearly succeeding. Andrei launched three attacks and never hit the target. The enemy managed to evade the blow in a fraction of a second before contact. At such a pace Andrey could waste all his energy and give the victory to his opponent, losing on points.
In addition, the "sisters" finally believed that Olga had decided to remain neutral, and began to approach Lunev from behind. This was not the point at all. No one knows what they were armed with, under the hoods could not be seen, but even if they just clawed, the expected minimum of pleasure. And if they managed to tear off a second set of protective artifacts...
"They might! I don't see why they can't use their hypnosis to nail me, since four of the creatures had been doing a good job, Joker notwithstanding, but I'd be damned if my luck was going to run out and I'd be in a very tricky situation. So much so that I might get ticklish all over myself.
Olga hardly caught Andrew's thoughts, but further events suddenly began to develop more rapidly than before, and clearly according to her script. At first Andrew did not realize it, hesitated for a moment and once again let the nimble Engineer out of his sight. However, he quickly oriented himself in the changed situation and concentrated on the main goal....</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_faction_mar_a9_doc_8">
    <text>...The Furies moved in on the Old One, and Olga finally made a decision. Whatever the threat, she must complete the mission. And complete it in the same formation in which she had begun. What she was now, human or creature, did not matter to her. As long as there was any humanity left in her soul, she must remain human. "We are what we feel we are, even if the facts stubbornly say otherwise." Clinging to that thought, Olga waded out of the icy lake of indifference and stepped onto solid ground. On the same ground from which the hurricane of emotions had pushed her into the cold water a few minutes before.
Olga glanced at the assault rifle the sisters had thrown away, but changed her mind about picking up the weapon. Some were worthy of a bullet, some were supposed to die of poison, and some had pity to waste even a piece of stump.
"To the creatures... dog's death!" Olga, not knowing why herself, suddenly had complete confidence in her new talents and powers. She snapped her fingers, and in a second all ten of the dogs that guarded the lair staggered into the hall. The dogs lined up neatly, in the envy of all soldiers, and bellowed softly. Somehow Olga knew that the dogs knew what controllers tasted like, and they liked the taste.
- Fass," Olga ordered softly, at the same time imagining exactly who she was setting the dogs on.
Of the four targets Olga had mentally identified, the dogs attacked only three. No, they were not averse to tearing the former master to shreds as well, but the artifact protecting the Engineer prevented them from even approaching the fourth victim.
The hall was filled with the uterine growls of the dogs and the screams of the dying sisters...
...Andrei didn't have to turn around to see what was happening behind his back. Olga's thoughts were clear to him. Weapons in the castle were of little importance. It was more important to seize the initiative and get as many allies on his side as possible. Subjugating the Cerbers was an excellent idea. Now the men could concentrate entirely on the main task, without worrying about the rear. Even if the Engineer called in some more creatures for help, the dogs would be done with them in a heartbeat.
The Engineer realized he was losing too, so he decided not to take any chances. He yanked the crystal chain from around his neck and clenched his greatest asset in his fist. The milky white light faded for a moment, then seeped through his fingers and trickled down to his feet. Touching the ground, the moon's milk boiled and turned into a glowing mist. A low wave of mist swiftly spread out to the sides and froze, bounding in a circle twenty metres in diameter. As soon as the glowing mist stopped, the figure of the Engineer became blurred and very soon disappeared. As soon as this happened, the pattern of the glow changed. The mist took on a greenish hue. As far as Old understood, this meant that the passage from Sector Thirteen to the outside world was open. Andrei turned sharply and waved vigorously at Olga. She rushed to Tatiana, lifted her to her feet and pushed her into the circle. Tatiana was clearly not herself yet and barely kept her balance. Andrei firmly grasped her friend's arm and with a nod pointed to the centre of the circle.
- Yes, yes, I understand," Tatiana whispered. - And Olga?
- Go on, I'll catch up! - Olga shouted, leaning over Scout.
- He'll close the passage!
- No." Olga waved her hand. - The corridors close by themselves, not before a minute! Go!...
...The room where the walkers found themselves, stepping into the outside world, looked even stranger than the hall in the ruins of the castle. The room, once a two story building, had been reduced to a mere dozen spires between the windows, the only thing left of the first floor and the roof. The visitors had the impression of being trapped inside the jaws of a long-rotten dinosaur, sunk into the ground. The concrete debris and brick crumbs in the building formed several distinctive hills covered with wind-blown leaves and the ubiquitous dirt. All in all, the picture was typical of the Zone, especially the thoroughly destroyed Pripyat. And that the passage led exactly to Pripyat, Andrei had no doubt. He knew what the building was. A spot of contact opened up inside the ruins of the jetty. Somewhere beyond the right jagged wall splashed the cooling pond, tall trees peered into the ruins on the left, and directly, if one climbed one of the piles of rubble, one could see the roof of the cafe, which had miraculously withstood the blows of both Catastrophes. Indirectly Andrei's conviction was confirmed by the reaction of the instruments. In Tatiana's pocket a dosimeter beeped. Around the pier the radiation background was always quite high.
Familiar surroundings instilled additional confidence in their own abilities and helped them concentrate. Even the alarm buzzer of the dosimeter failed to distract Andrei from the search for the enemy lurking somewhere between the rubble. The old man was somehow certain that the Engineer had not left the building. In the short time of confrontation in the castle it was as if he had learned to sense the enemy. Although everything could be explained in simpler terms - the clues were coming from Olga.
Andrew gestured for Tatiana to stay where she was. She tried to hand him a gun, but Lunev shook his head negatively. How to kill the Engineer, Andrew now knew exactly. No weapon he needed for that. None. Just the Joker.
The enemy was bluffing, claiming that the contact of the white and red artifacts would cause disaster. They could destroy each other, but not their owners and certainly not their immediate surroundings. But the Engineer feared the loss of the crystal, for it would indeed be a disaster for all his plans. And for him personally as well. After all, Andrei would then gain a serious advantage. In addition to the Joker, the former mercenary still had the amulet blocking psi-impact, which meant that the chances of the controller and the man were even. Almost. The Old One's chances looked even preferable.
Whether or not the Engineer reasoned that way was unknown to Andrei, but the enemy was in no hurry to get out of the ruins, that was a fact. The old man looked closely at his surroundings and noticed a faint white glow in the left corner of the ruined dock's cash room.
Lunev moved cautiously in the direction of the glow, but managed to walk only a couple of metres. The pile of debris separating him from his opponent suddenly soared into the air, as if it had been lifted by a mighty whirlwind, and hovered for a moment and collapsed to the ground. In such circumstances there was no time for beautiful acrobatics, and Andrew simply jumped back and awkwardly flopped on his back, two steps away from Tatiana.
- I thought he would be weaker here," Andrei confessed, getting up. - Almost fell down, bastard!
- Andrew, do not! - Naively trying to disperse a hand swirling dust around, Tatiana begged. - Let him go! He will not let you closer!
- No!
Lunev's answer seemed to echo through the ruins and made them tremble. The effect was strange, but understandable. Quite simply, at the same time as the Old One's answer, the Engineer lurking in the ruins struck again. The teeth on the walls began to crumble and crumble into large fragments, exclusively inside the building. A minute of such a collapse and people could be covered with debris up to their necks.
Andrew pushed Tatiana to the nearest gap and pointed at darkening bushes behind it.
- Go away!
- I won't go without you!
- At least just get out of this trap. Wait for me in the thicket!
- ß... I'm scared!
- Don't argue! If you hear footsteps or rustling in the thicket, don't hesitate to shoot. If I'm not back in five minutes, go south to the old jetty! That's the checkpoint. They'll take you from there.
- Andrei!
- That's it! The matter is closed!
Lunev pushed Tatiana out of the danger zone, then turned and dove into the dust thicket. He poorly imagined how to get under the stone rain to the position of the enemy, but he hoped that the "Joker" will help him in this difficult matter.
"The Joker did help, but in another way. Barely had he passed the glowing ring of the exit point, clearly visible even in the dust, the Engineer struck again, now in full contact.
He suddenly sprang up directly in front of Old and with a swift movement plunged a long, translucent, glowing stiletto into Andrew's chest.
Lunev has time to realize that it's not a stiletto, and transformed into a strange weapon crystal, but evade the blow or block it somehow Andrew did not have time. Or maybe he didn't want to. But in that case he did, reacting instantly to a new clue from the outside.
In a thousandth of a second a dozen anxious thoughts flashed through his brain, but only one stuck in his mind: "Everything is right.
What could be right when a knife was plunged into your chest, Andrew did not understand, and yet he did not challenge the dubious thought. As it turned out in the next thousandth of a second, he did the right thing.
The gleaming stiletto struck as if it had struck armor. It struck the armor so hard it shot out a shower of bright red and white flames that almost scorched Lunev's face and clothing. The crystal had actually struck the Joker, but that didn't change the matter. Except that it disproved all assumptions at all, both the Old One and the Engineer's. The artifacts didn't destroy each other. Only hit each other just as hard as the owners.
The force with which the artifacts pushed away from each other was so great that the weapon fell out of the Engineer's hand and flew aside. Lunev was once again thrown back two metres and collapsed backwards.
"That's the end of you, you beast! - A new thought occurred to Andrei. - Were you afraid of a disaster? Get disaster!"
Andrew leapt to his feet, lunged forward, grabbed his opponent by the throat and gripped his fingers tightly...
... The first thing Olga saw, finding herself in the outside world, was a fountain of red and white sparks, exploding somewhere deep in the dust curtain on the other side of the greenish glow. And the first thing she felt was a not too strong, but painful blow to her shoulder. It was as if some hooligan had fired a weighty piece of gravel from a slingshot. Olga lowered her gaze and was surprised to find a milky-white, slightly glowing crystal lying at her feet. It was mounted on a silver chain. The crystal did not shine as brightly in the outside world as it did in the Thirteenth Sector, but it was still impossible to mistake it for anything else.
Olga crouched down and carefully touched the artifact. There was nothing scary about it. Then she picked up the thing and twirled it, trying to examine it from all sides. She did not like what she saw. No, the crystal was not flawed or anything like that. The thing itself was perfect, but the way it affected her mind frightened Olga a little. The girl did not begin to turn into the same soulless creature that the previous owner of the crystal had turned out to be. Olga remained herself, except that her ability to peer into the thoughts and feelings of those around her had increased dramatically and seemed to be out of her control. Olga did not want this at all, but the Key made her a very powerful psionic, it literally unlocked all the most secret storerooms of any consciousness. Or rather, not any consciousness, but the one that was closest or most disposed to telepathic contact.
Olga sensed four minds nearby. One was of little interest to her. No, she would not mind to wring a few intimate secrets out of him, but the situation did not dispose for such entertainment. So Olga left Tatiana alone.
The second mind was clouded. And the third, Andrei's mind, was completely subordinate to the fight with the enemy, in addition, protected from outside interference by the "Joker". The cunning artifact perfectly filtered any signals from the outside. Business advice it let in, but nonsense, and even more attempts to get into the mind of a person for the purpose of intelligence, cut off instantly.
That left the mind of the Engineer. Olga desperately didn't want to get into it, but the crystal demanded action, and it wasn't a bad idea to distract the enemy.
She plunged into the mind of the enemy, but saw only one picture, which had nothing to do with what was now happening in the ruins, but for some reason occupied all the thoughts of the Engineer.
Olga saw a frozen frame from six years ago, showing several monsters killing a woman. Olga felt as if she were being burned. She suddenly remembered her endless dream and clearly understood what fragment had fallen forever out of her memory of the events of that six-year ago....</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_faction_mar_a9_doc_9">
    <text>...It was the same frame as the one that now stood before the Engineer's inner gaze. With the same characters, in the same place, only from a different perspective: from the perspective of a man sitting on the ground five metres away from the maddening feast of monsters. The frame was so hard on the psyche that Olga's mind simply blotted it out of her memories, replacing it with the dark gap between the disaster and the soldier's appearance. Now, however, Olga was slowly but surely remembering everything that had happened before and everything that had happened after. 
She remembered hiding in the ruins with her mother, wounded in the disaster, how the monsters had attacked them, and her mother had tried to save Olga by taking the blow for herself. How someone resembling her father had appeared from afar, and how terrifying it was to discover that it was not her father, but another monster... 
Now Olga remembered everything and realised the main thing: she had not been entirely wrong in those nightmarish moments. The Engineer who had killed her father was indeed one of those monsters. Who had killed her father and then her mother... 
And in the depths of the Engineer's mind at that moment he remained aware that he was killing and eating his own wife. That's why the first victim remains in the monster's memory... 

... Olga with an incredible effort of will forced herself to surface from the new lake of icy fear and, with a hearty swing, toss the crystal where intuition dictated.
As it turned out a second later, intuition had told me the only right direction...
...Strangling the monster was not easy. For one thing, the mutant's cold skin beneath Andrei's fingers was suddenly slippery like ice, and for another, the Engineer suddenly began to morph into something even more unpleasant than an advanced version of a controller. The monster's body had stretched so far that Andrew was no longer able to reach its neck, and instead of a face, a huge, toothy snout, resembling most closely the snout of an ancient reptile, began to form. Long claws dug into Old Man's shoulders, and the cloak tangled around his legs and seemed to Andrei to have become two scaly tails. It was unlikely that any of this was really happening. More likely, the dying creature had gathered its remaining strength, and in a last desperate attempt to attack the enemy with its gift of suggestion. A cornered beast is always particularly dangerous. But whether it was illusion or reality, once again the Engineer had a chance to pull through, and there was nothing Andrei could do to prevent it.
The creature, transformed into a slimy, scaly beast, opened its enormous jaws and loomed over the man, clearly intent on biting his head off. Andrei involuntarily pulled his head into his shoulders and also made a desperate attempt to escape the monster's claws. The sharp pain in his body, slashed by the monster's claws, had literally paralyzed the Old One, and all he had to do was watch the jaws dotted with sharp teeth approach.
To be honest, Andrew couldn't imagine such an ending even in his wildest dreams. Ideally, it would have been better to close his eyes, but the Old One couldn't even do that. He was forced to accept death with his visor open, like a medieval knight in the clutches of a dragon. Though he would have preferred to do without such dubious romance.
For a moment Andre imagined the monstrous jaws closing on him, and him seeing the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. The old man grinned mentally. In the rather tiresome gloom of the Zone, seeing the light, at least in this version, was not a bad thing.
"And to hell with that! I did what I could! Don't mention it!"
Suddenly a source of soft white light flashed before Andrei's eyes, but it was definitely not the light Andrei had prepared to see. The unknown firefly swiftly flew into the monster's mouth and disappeared somewhere in its throat.
For a few seconds nothing happened at all. The monster froze with its jaws open, neither tightening nor loosening its grip. Andrei stopped fluttering and froze in anticipation as well. By the third second of the strange pause something had changed, but in what direction, Old only realized three more seconds later. A bright white glow illuminated the monster's mouth and burst out. The monster's fingers immediately loosened and its scaly tails hung limply.
Andrei collapsed backwards for the third time and, still unable to move, stared at the glowing monster from within. The engineer no longer looked like a monster but had assumed his former appearance, the only difference being that white light flashed from his mouth and eyes, while his previously grayish skin was tinged with blue.
The Engineer didn't glow like that for long. The glow suddenly intensified dramatically and burst out in a hundred places at once. The body of the Engineer was covered in a network of glowing cracks, like that lava in a river of fire, and then exploded with the sound of a burst tyre. Thousands of cold shards scattered in different directions, lavishing the walls and piles of rubble with thousands of black and red smudges.
A second later the ruins were illuminated by a new flash, now greenish. It was the outline of a misty access point ring that flared and disappeared. The exit from Sector Thirteen closed. But Lunev didn't see that anymore. Didn't want to look.
Andrei pressed the back of his head against the cold crumb of brick rubble, exhaled noisily, and closed his eyes. He didn't want anything else. First to look, second to wonder. Even to wipe the enemy's black blood from his face and brush away bits of his flesh. He was back in control of his body, the paralyzing pain gone as if it hadn't existed, but he didn't want to move, for the life of him. Andrei wanted nothing at all. Not even to find out what had really happened.
"Put it all down! No me. Not for anyone! Forever!"
- Nice shot. You should play what's-his-name... play baseball, Olya," a familiar voice cracked from the corner.
- Shut your mouth," Olga answered muffled.
- She mumbled, and Olga answered muffled, "I must drag the officer to the water to wash him up or he won't wake up till morning. Untie me, I'll help you.
- Calm down.
- Hey, what's glowing there? That crystal, right? It's over there in the junk.
- Scout, you wanna chew on a gag?
- Silence!
Unfortunately, even a sleeping man always has at least one of his six senses working. No, not intuition. It's hearing. And there's no getting away from that fact. Whether you are there or not, for everyone or for someone in particular, you cannot cheat physiology. You hear everything and everyone. Andrew gritted his teeth and opened his eyes.
"I want to, I don't want to, but I have to. And think, and move, and do everything else. Bloody work!"
Andrew sat up slowly and wiped his face with his sleeve.
- Andre!" He heard hurried footsteps behind him. - Are you all right?!
Lunev looked up. Beside him crouched down Tatiana. A little behind her stood Olga. Again indifferent, as in the castle, but now clearly depressed.
- All right. - Andrei gestured for Tatiana to hold back the rest of the questions.
He ran his hand behind his sinus and pulled out a raw strap. As Andrei had expected, the leather pouch containing the Joker was not on the strap. When the Engineer had managed to tear the main protection of the neck of his opponent, Andrew could only guess, but now he knew exactly why he almost lost the decisive stage of the fight. The amulet alone could not cope with the compulsion of such a strong controller. So, if it hadn't been for Olga's throw...
Andrei glanced at Olga.
- Olga, what did you throw?
- The crystal, the "Key", - Olga answered without intonation, and slid an indifferent glance to the place where a minute before a man and a monster were fighting.
- 'Thank you. Just in time. Another second and he could have overpowered me.
- You're welcome. It was an accident. Reflexive.
- Nice of him to bang it to pieces! - Scout couldn't help but retort. - And why? Did you pick the wrong sauce for that crystal? Choked?
- Out of spite he burst," Olga muttered. - Shut up, I warned you.
Andrew turned around and shot a glance at the stalker. He was bound hand and foot and sat near the wall to the left of the hole in which Tatiana was hiding.
- Why did you bring him? - Andrew grinned. - Let him stay in the Thirteenth, that's where he belongs.
- You said yourself, how many of us came, so much will go. - Olga shrugged. - The crystal over there, you can send it back.
- Not likely," remarked Tatiana. - How to open the passages with this artifact, only the Engineer knew. As far as I understood, one had to know something peculiar for that.
- A spell, or what? - Scout snorted. - Don't be absurd! What am I to do in the Thirteenth?
- What about the prison? - Olga asked calmly.
- There is nothing to do there either! Untie me, I beg you, I'll go far away, I'll never come back, I give you my word!
- Olga, gag him," suggested Andrei, tiredly. - Or shoot him. I've had enough of him.
- Naughty! - Scout muttered angrily. - It is the mistake of a man, it does not happen with whom! And you shoot at him at once! I am silent, you will not utter another word!
Andrew got up and approached Olga.
- I am sorry that you have gone through so much.
- No more than you have. - Olga looked away. - That creature wasn't my father, I already told you back there in the sector. It was just a monster who had taken on his disguise. I lost both of my parents in Chernobyl during the second catastrophe.
- It was harder for you than it was for us, anyway. - Andrei took her hand. - I saw it.
- Don't, Old One. - Olga released her hand. - Just because I hung there doesn't mean anything. Yes, I had a slight shock at first, but common sense kept me from making the wrong choice. When I had the crystal in my hands, I was able to look into the hidden thoughts of my enemy, and I saw something in them that finally convinced me. I now know for certain that I did the right thing.
- What did you see?
- I don't want to talk about it. It's too personal. It doesn't matter now. Let's just figure out how to get out of here. We're almost in the middle of nowhere again.
- Only this time it's not an hour before ejection. There's time. We'll make it. Untie Scout's legs, I'm not dragging him.
Andrei walked over to where the Engineer had died and looked at what was left of him. The monster had been torn to shreds, only it hadn't 'burst from anger', but rather turned inside out. Or, more accurately, incapable of living in two dimensions at once. The crystal he had swallowed provided such an opportunity, but the Engineer took advantage of it incorrectly. Andrew pulled the chain with the crystal from the pool of black blood and wiped the "Key" with a scrap of cloth found nearby, probably a piece of the Engineer's cloak. The crystal glowed as before, not too brightly, but evenly, one might say solidly. Andrew clutched the crystal in his fist and glanced around the battlefield, hoping to find the Joker as well. That proved to be more difficult. In the outside world the artifact was not glowing, and was packed in a leather pouch. In the semi-darkness, among the concrete rubble, it was impossible to find the thing. Andrew humbled himself and stood up.
- Crystal is a good compensation for all the lost artifacts, - said Tatiana.
- What?" Andrew turned around. - Oh, yes, it is good. But we do not need such compensation. It is too dangerous artifact.
- From the scientific point of view it is very interesting and...
- No. - Andrew pointed to the breach. - Let's go...</text>

    <text>- As you wish. - Tatiana sighed. - Hopefully we'll get some rest before we head back?
- We will. At the pier. Remember I told you? It's not far.
It was indeed a short walk to the old jetty. When the group had settled on the mossy stones, Andrew stepped aside and took out his communicator. He did not expect that the communication would be restored, but it suddenly revived and even made it possible to connect with the base at the first attempt. Or rather, not with the base, but with Beebik.
- The old one! - The colonel was clearly delighted. - Hello?
- Hello, Beebeek, do you copy?! - The receiver was crackling with interference and Andrei had to raise his voice.
- I hear, I hear!
- Do you hear?! - Andrew pressed the receiver to his ear. - Shit, it's interference! Alright, the hell with it, I report! The main enemy has been destroyed along with the main artifact. Do you hear me?!
- I'm not deaf! - I got an answer through the crackle and the hiss. - Oh, that's great! Well done! Where are you now?
- What?! Oh, I'm in Pripyat! Do you remember where we dredged up with you in the fall? Right there on that dock.
- Don't move, we'll send a chopper.
- Got it! When?!
- Soon!
- Roger that! Over and out.
Andrei switched off the communicator, slipped it into his pocket and turned to his companions. All three were looking at Lunev, but each of them had completely different expectations. Tatiana looked with concealed hope. She strongly discouraged stomping back through the Zone. Scout was not smiling to return either on foot or by helicopter. He clearly hoped that his former comrades would show leniency and let him go on his merry way. Olga looked... nothing. Just watching. She did not seem to care whether to return or not.
Andrei understood her. Where to go back to when your home is the whole Zone now? From your bedroom to the hallway? What would be the point? After all, in a day or two you'll have to go into the depths of this house anyway.
Andrew nodded at once to all three of them, but said nothing. Each of the companions was free to understand it as he pleased. And everyone understood correctly. Tatiana sighed in relief, Scout soured and Olga lowered her gaze and stared at the rough stones.
Andrei turned away again and walked to the very edge of the jetty. He well remembered diving into the pond a little to the right of this spot in October. And how he had almost become the dinner of a giant catfish inhabiting a deep bottom hole not far from the jetty. Lunev slipped his hand into his pocket again, but this time he pulled out a crystal rather than a communicator. The thing still glowed faintly, radiating calm, as if trying to impress upon its new owner that with it he would know no worries and would be able to defeat any enemy.
"Liar, you glassy thing. You'll be nothing but worries and problems. And me, and the whole Zone. It's not certain that there will be a new Engineer capable of using you as a weapon, but I can't allow even the slightest possibility of such an option. Don't begrudge it."
Andrew swung briefly and threw the artifact into the pond, roughly where the very centre of the bottom hole was hidden under the water column.
- What a weirdo! - Scout muttered softly. - He's thrown away a lot of loot. He had sunk a wagon of money, I reckon. Beebick was right to say you were crazy.
- Do you think he'll keep it? - Olga stood next to Andrei.
- Who, the catfish? I think so. Under this fish's protection, the thing will be safe. Which means the Zone will be, too. Do you mind?
- No, I would do the same. - Olga held out her hand. - I have to go, Old One. Thanks for everything.
- Are you sure you don't want to go back? There's plenty for you to do in the Borderlands.
- I'm sure. My whole life is here now. With my heritage. Now if you'll excuse me, Old One, I have to go. I need to be alone.
- I understand. - Andrei shook her hand. - Remember, you can always come to me. I'll be sure to help.
- Okay. - Olga grinned sadly and looked at Tatiana. - I wish you great personal happiness.
- You too.
- Who am I with? - She moved her gaze to Scout. - With him, is it? He wouldn't be out of the joint till he retired. Didn't even want to. Goodbye.
Andrew saw her off with a long glance, and when Olga disappeared into the thicket, nodded.
- Goodbye. Though I am sure we will meet again. The Zone is such a tiny patch... You'll meet anyone, sooner or later. You made sure of that.</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a10_doc_8">
    <text>A flaming corridor lined with flamethrowers and phosphorus grenades allowed the strike team to advance only two hundred meters. The barricades prevented them from going any further. The APCs attempted to take the obstacle on the move, but the first vehicle failed and got bogged down, while the second, for reasons unknown, caught fire. The loss of the armoured personnel carriers was a tangible blow, but the fighters coped with the problem. They created a corridor to bypass the blockage and the BMPs which had followed the APCs made it through after all. They were followed by the main column. As Bibik had predicted, the toxic smoke, enveloping the battlefield, reduced visibility to zero and the soldiers had to break through literally by touch.
It was impossible to calculate how many soldiers were killed in the smoke inferno, but overall the strike team completed its task. The corridor allowed the garrison to leave the citadel and break out into the field.
At first things were no better in the field than they were outside the warehouse complex. The mutants constantly attacked from all sides, and even from the air. But once the men managed to make their way to the old canal, Bibik's plan worked just as the colonel had hoped. Two of the four BMPs left at the disposal of the garrison took the group of special forces and three flamethrowers on armour and moved as a leading patrol. The flamethrowers directly from the sides of the boxes set fire to the forest to the right of the column, while the rest of the fighters covered them from the monsters and assisted in the fire work with grenades. As a result, when the column pulled into the new corridor, the picture of the route was painted, what they call, in oil. Fifty meters to the right the forest was in flames, two steps to the left a muddy canal was splashing, the column was covered from above by thick clouds of smoke, and from the rear - two more BMPs and a barrage of "cleaners", cutting off pursuing mutants with heavy fire from machine guns and the same grenades.
That is not to say that the plan was perfect. The heat of the close-range fire tended to kill not only the monsters, but the initiators of the mayhem themselves. Every half a minute people drew muddy water from the canal with their helmets and poured it over themselves to escape the heat. From the swirling clouds of smoke hanging over the column the "batsmen", completely insane with toxic phosphorus smoke, were thrown down. Fearless pseudo-giants attempted to force their way through the channel. And bloodsuckers were persistently crawling under the tracks of the lead vehicles. However, all these problems were no longer as serious as before. The mutants were clearly not as well prepared for the maneuvering battle as they were for the siege.
They were soon to find that they had at least one more trump card up their sleeve. Even two: psi-attack and bribery. And if the first problem was more or less dealt with: the special forces were pumped with special drugs, the "cleaners" also swallowed some pills, and the stalkers protected themselves with artifacts, then the problem of bribery was much harder to deal with. Later on, however, it turned out that it wasn't really about bribery.
It started at the gate. Several stalkers suddenly tried to attack the general. Performing the role of staff guards Lieutenant Pashkov's men, as well as Bibik personally, had to work hard to drive away the invading gang. In the smoke and confusion, the aggressive stalkers were lost for a while, but when the column entered the route, they reappeared. This time Bibik almost missed the moment of the attack, but it all worked out. The colonel personally kicked three saboteurs in the snot, and three more were taken care of by the commandos. A third attack did not follow, although it became clear that the saboteur group had not yet been completely destroyed. Two of the outsiders were captured and brought for interrogation to Bibik by the stalkers themselves.
- They were not with us in the depots! - One of militiamen has confidently declared. - They joined us behind the gates! And dressed, look yourself, like blue!
- I see, I am not blind. - Bibik pointed the submachine gun on one of the saboteurs. - Who hired them? Who were they hunting?
- Fuck you," the mercenary gritted through his teeth.
- Wrong answer. - Bibic pierced the enemy with a short burst and pushed the body into the canal. - I repeat the question.
He pointed his weapon at the other.
- The mediators don't tell us who the hireling is! - the second mercenary panicked.
- Well, they're marking the target. - Bibic shoved the barrel of his gun under his nose. - Who was the contract for?!
- The general!
- How did you get through the barricades, who guided you?
- I don't know!
- Wrong answer!
- He was wearing a hoodie! He was pushing his brains out like a controller! Wouldn't let me see him!
- Right. Beebeek spat angrily. - So you've got no conscience, have you, you little shit? You're working for the mutants, aren't you? Don't you hate it?
- It's just a job! It's nothing personal!
- You've seen too many movies, haven't you? "Nothing personal"! Go back to your friends if you don't care who you serve! On your feet! Get up!
Bibic grabbed the mercenary by the collar, pushed him sharply to his feet, and pushed him hard toward the canal.
- ß... Where shall I... go? - The mercenary looked back frightened.
- Go ahead! Swim to the other side!
- That way?! There are beasts there! You'd better slap it here!
- Shit question. - Bibic raised his gun.
- No!" The mercenary dived into the water and swam to the other side.
He reached the middle of the canal. In the light of the nearby forest fire it was clearly visible as the water around the mercenary suddenly boiled up as if boiling, and the man screamed shrilly. Hundreds of small but toothy fish swarmed over him, stripping him to the bone in a matter of seconds. His screams were still echoing through the water, but it was already over.
- They used to have better mercenaries," said Bebbik, spitting again, and pulled his mask back on. - Now they just pick anybody they can get their hands on. Pashkov, bring up the laggards! Do not stretch! I to the general.
- Yes, sir!
Bibik managed to make only a dozen steps in the direction of the head of the column, as a lieutenant called him.
- Colonel!
- What do you want now? - Bibik looked around.
- The beast lags behind! - Pashkov pushed forward the fighter of "cleaners". - Here, a messenger came running.
- Speak. - Bibik stopped and waited for the messenger.
- There's, uh... we're out of grenades, so we saw it. No beasts in the rear! They flicker in the distance, but they won't follow us.
- Very much they need to go on the burning ground. - Bibik grinned.
- No, well... there is not enough of it on this side too. - Combatant pointed to the left. - And no more falling from the sky. And the inspectors don't shit on your brains. The sergeant sent it to you to tell you that... that's it, let it go.
- Dismissed. - Bibic nodded and glanced around the area.
The sergeant commanding the rearguard seemed to be right on all counts. The mutants had clearly left the convoy alone, moreover, began to retreat in the direction of the Zone. What the reason was, one could only guess. Perhaps the mutant command somehow got wind of the fact that any minute now the infernal army would be attacked by stormtroopers, or something happened in the "headquarters" of the beastly horde... in principle, it didn't matter. The fact remained the fact either way. The monsters were retreating.
Somewhere high, above the solid smoke screen, multiple peals of thunder rolled in, and Bibic involuntarily looked up.
- What was that? Planes? - Pashkov was surprised.
- Stormtroopers. - Colonel nodded. - Goodbye, base.
- Stormtroopers?! - The lieutenant rejoiced. - A counterattack?
- Sort of. - Bibik lowered his gaze. - Why are you still here? Where did I send you?
- Well, now...
- All the more reason to pull up now. So that in five minutes the column will be more compact than a pack of biscuits! On the double!
- Yes, sir!
This time Pashkov made it to the tail of the column without a hitch. But Bibik didn't make it to the general's Hummer. He was intercepted by a new messenger, now from the head patrol.
- Tanks, Colonel! They're at Stepanivka! No communication, but they're beeping, they see us.
- Why aren't they coming towards us?
- They're probably afraid we'll set them on fire. Nobody understands their signals. The commander sent me to ask if anyone in the column knows it.
- What, morse code? - Bibic turned the fighter around. - Come on, I'm on it. Soldiers, damn it! They're used to talking on their mobile phones even in the field! It's called Special Forces! What's going on? The mercenaries have gone gutless, the Special Forces don't know morse code... what's going on?!
- Stop grumbling. - Ostapenko, escorted by three soldiers, drove out of the smokescreen ahead of Bibik.
- Tanks straight ahead, General.
- I heard that. Let's go. What kind of shooting was that?
- Ah, so... saboteurs were caught.
- Who?
- Mercenaries," said Bibik. - They came for your soul, by the way.
- Interrogated?
- I told you...
- That it was for me, I see, what else did they say?
- Nothing more. They couldn't have said anything else. They were given a target, so they worked it.
- Who hired them?
- Unknown, only I think... the mutants hired them.
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not. Judge for yourself: the mercenaries weren't hiding among the citadel defenders, they came from the outside. That's what the stalkers confirm. The controllers led them through the menagerie, the prisoner confirms it. So the controllers hired them, too.
- Hired or forced?
- That's the thing, they were hired.
- Things take an interesting turn," said Ostapenko thoughtfully.
- Not any more. - He pointed behind him with his thumb. - The beast is retreating. I do not think it is for nothing.
- Are you saying the reason for that retreat might be in the Thirteenth Sector?
- I don't know, but the timing's right. Oh, I wish we could get a connection! But it's just these damn crossing points that's making the airwaves go haywire. Vaughn, I can't even contact the tanks.
- There's a connection! - suddenly shouted one of the soldiers, sitting on the armored leading BMP. - Yurka, to the general, quick!
- Yes, they are already there! - shouted the messenger accompanying the boss...
- General, the box is on the line!
- I'm coming. - Ostapenko jumped on the armour and took the headset from the soldier's hands.
In the same second a deafening roar rolled over the field, as if a whole squad of drummers started banging nearby. On railway tanks with sledgehammers. It was impossible to hear anything in such rumbling, and Ostapenko was forced to join the crowd of gawkers which the whole column had turned into.
Just three kilometres to the northeast, the twilight first thickened for a moment, as if an invisible giant had blown out all the napalm fires left in D-3, and then lit up with bright flashes. It was the stormtroopers that began to work on the Dityatki-3 base and the surrounding areas. This bacchanalia lasted only a couple of minutes, but as soon as the planes went into a turn, the flames over the base, which had been knocked out by the explosions, rose up again to the smoky skies.
- God forgive us our sins. - Bibik crossed himself and sighed. - No more base.
- Hello, box, General Ostapenko speaking! - General took advantage of the pause.
- We moved towards you, General! - answered the tank commander. - Try to pass at least another five hundred metres! Don't burn the forest, it's already clear!
- Understood, let's go. - Ostapenko looked at the commander of the head vehicle and waved: "Forward!"
- And the "combs" seem to be gone, - jumped on the armour, reported Bibik. - Do you hear the silence?
Ostapenko turned his head and nodded. Silence was relative. Shooting, explosions, roar of motors and other sounds of fighting in the field have not disappeared yet, except that it became less intense, but the large caliber has really quieted down. And there were no more jet turbines rumbling overhead.
- Now let's find out from the tank crews what is going on. Apparently they have better communication than we do.
The meeting with the tank battalion took place in five minutes. The commander of the "box", a moustached stocky major, immediately flew up to the general.
- What news? - listening to the report Ostapenko asked. - Is there a connection with the headquarters?
- We do now, General! As soon as the "hole" was closed, the communication was established at once.
- "The burrow closed? - Ostapenko glanced meaningfully at Bibik.
- Yes, the attackers reported it. They were approaching the target, and suddenly it was extinguished.
- And why the hell were they bombing then? - Bibik muttered.
- Orders. - The tankman shrugged his shoulders. - But there would be no the second approach. The combs have gone to the base.
- Where mutants leave, they did not inform?
- It is badly visible. But they seem to be going to the centre of the Zone. There's an order for you from HQ, General. The D-3 garrison has been ordered to return to its deployment site. To put out the fires. They've sent firefighters from Dymer, and by morning they'll come from Kiev. But for now you'll have to do it on your own.
- Why did you come here?
- We'll move on, to the first line of checkpoints. We'll stand there.
- Any chance the beasts will come back? Is HQ expecting a counterattack?
- No, General, just insurance.
- Where you were before, insurers, dammit! - barked angrily at Bibik. - Now of course! On pure terrain, why not to ride the tanks!
- There was no order. - The major stared at Bibik with honest eyes. - And you think, that we were not gnawed? We are not animals, we understood everything. As soon as the order came, we rushed here at maximum speed.
- Alright, let's forget it. - The colonel waved his hand.
- Here here is the matter. - The tankman lowered his voice conspiratorially and slightly moved forward. - There was a mess in the HQ. Yes what ... mess! I just got a call from a comrade from Kiev. He said that the inspectors were caught not far from the staff, who were putting pressure on the generals and organising diversions! Can you imagine?! They said they set fire to the counter-intelligence headquarters and the Main Military Science Laboratory building.
- Hello, there. - Ostapenko grudgingly grimaced. - Did they put it out?
- It seems to have been put out, but what damage, I don't know.
- However seriously this time the beasts have approached to business, - remarked Bibik. - They have sent agents to the headquarters, burned the counter-intelligence, almost killed you. They grow.
- Let`s hope, that they will not grow any higher, - said Ostapenko with intonation completing the conversation. - Major, give my men a lift to the base.
- Yes! - The major waited till the general and colonel returned to the Hummer and shouted: - Hey, screws, get on the armor!
- Aren't we going to get petroleum residue all over the place? - Someone from a column shouted.
- Talkers! Get in, while we are kind, we'll drive straight to the camp.
- Are you crazy?! It's all on fire! They want to take us back, guys!
- Die, you bots! - shouted from a group of stalkers. - If it's necessary, then it's necessary! You're in the Zone, not at the resort!
Continued verbal altercation drowned out the roar of tank turbines. Ostapenko sat down in the Hummer next to the driver and stared thoughtfully out the windshield. Beebik was impatient to discuss the news, but he still held a minute pause for decency and only then asked:
- Do you think the assassination attempt and arson were planned in Thirteen?
- You think so too, don't you?
- Right, but...
Bibic didn't finish the sentence. His communicator suddenly buzzed in his pocket.
- It is alive! - the colonel rejoiced. - Mister General, Old calling!
- Put it on loudspeaker, - ordered Ostapenko.
Bibik put on speakerphone and answered the call.
- Oldy, I'm listening to you!
- Hello, Bibik, can you hear me?!
- I hear you, I hear you!
- Can you hear me?! Shit, it's interference! All right, fuck it, I'm reporting! The main enemy has been destroyed, along with the main artifact. Do you hear me?!
- I'm not deaf! Oh, great! Well done! Where are you now?
- What?! Oh, I'm in Pripyat! Do you remember where we dredged up with you in the fall? Right there on that dock.
- Don't move, we'll send a chopper.
- Got it! When?!
- Soon!
- Roger that! Over and out.
- Did I say anything unnecessary? - When you hung up, Bibik asked Ostapenko.
- Do you hear? - The general lifted his index finger up.
- I hear. - The colonel leaned against the window. - Everything is in smoke. But it sounded like helicopters. Only it's probably the fire department.
- So we'll send in the fire department and get some water from the pond. You got a line on duty?
- We'll set it up.
When communication was established, Ostapenko had a short but productive conversation with the headquarters. On the one hand it was indirectly the fault of the chief of counterintelligence that the generals were brainwashed by agents of the enemy, but on the other hand it became clear that not all staff members were under the psi-control. And why they, in their right mind, had nearly destroyed the entire system of isolation of the Zone, was a much more delicate question than all the questions to the counterintelligence all together. In general, "just in case" in the headquarters were very happy that Ostapenko was alive, and emphasized their joy in every possible way. Including the readiness to execute any order of the general. Instantly and in the best possible way.
- They are right, - Bibik commented on what they heard. - You are going to twist them all. I only did not understand, will they send a helicopter?
- Already sent. It will be in place in half an hour.
- That's good. - Bibik nodded.
- What?" asked Ostapenko thoughtfully.
- 'Everything! And that Old coped, and that the mutants were "released" in time. You would have been killed sooner or later, otherwise. Not them, but the mercenaries. By the way, if the mutants have recovered, and the "burrow" disappeared thanks to Old, you owe him.
- When he returns, we'll figure out who owes who. - Ostapenko took off his cap and wiped away his sweat. - How did he say it? "The main enemy destroyed along with the main artifact?"
- Well. So?
- Nothing.
- So?
- Why did he mention a "major artifact"? The only thing I talked to him about at the time was the main enemy. There was no artifact involved.
- That's weird.
- That's what I'm talking about. The old one's being cagey, no doubt about it. And if he's being cagey, he must have done something wrong. Either with this mysterious "master artifact" or with Olga. So we'll see who owes whom and how much.
- Even so. - Bibic grinned indulgently. - The enemy is fleeing. We're going back to base. Your secret plan worked. As they say, I see no reason not to have a drink!</text>

<string id="enc_faction_mar_a10_doc_9">
    <text>Andrei was no stranger to flying up to D-3 in the middle of the night by helicopter, but never before had Lunev seen the base in such a deplorable state. From above, the drama of the situation could be fully appreciated, despite the thick smoke and darkness. In fact, there was no darkness at all, and the smoke was blown away by the wind, and it was hardly in the way. There was smouldering firewood all over the area, puddles of napalm and petrol not put out by the rampaging firefighters, burning cars and tents in the shopping arcade, and the illumination of the area was bright enough. Three searchlights on the roofs of the three surviving buildings of the warehouse complex, the legendary citadel, were also doing their best to illuminate the area. It was in the courtyard of the only relatively surviving object that the helicopter landed. Before it did so, however, it had to make a couple of circles over the ruins of the base - the soldiers had not had time to clear the landing pad of large debris, bodies and empty mine crates. It was during the unscheduled overflight of the area that Andrei saw the extent of the destruction.
Strictly speaking, the D-3 base had been wiped out. The three surviving buildings of the warehouse complex could only be considered the "salvaged regimental banner". But even if all eight of the two-storey warehouse buildings had survived the raid, the condition of the base would not have looked any less appalling. The warehouses comprised barely one-twentieth of the base's buildings, and the square footage was even smaller. And that was not counting the commercial sector, the tent city and the airfield. The vast area was a smouldering waste dump, a cemetery and a burial ground at the same time. The only thing almost nonexistent was radioactive waste. But this seemed a weak consolation.
The helicopter was finally cleared to land, and carefully squeezed the gray carcass into a tiny patch in the centre of the cleared parade ground. A very representative delegation of ten commandos led by Colonel Bibik met the newcomers at the edge of the improvised landing pad. As soon as the helicopter touched down on the pad, the soldiers formed a living corridor, ready to receive a particularly dangerous prisoner, who had been promised during the communication session with the approaching board. Seeing no one but themselves: Old, Tatiana and Scout, the soldiers began to look at Bibik in surprise, and finding that Scout unarmed and tied up, the commandos were completely confused.
Bibik beckoned them to remain calm and nodded for Andrei to step aside.
- Well, what shall we do with him?
- It's up to you to decide. - Andrei shrugged his shoulders. - He got everything from me.
- Well, you know there'll be a trial and everything. You'll be called as a witness...
- What do I want, you ask? - Andrew grinned. - No, you don't. You don't have to go to trial, you know how to do it.
- I know, but I have to have your consent.
- Let's not wash our dirty linen in public. - Lunev nodded. - After what we have gone through, anyone can go mad.
- Well. - Bibik nodded contentedly. - And he's still after the hospital. Rehabilitation wasn't over. And he had already had some nervous breakdowns. Two times he was in mental hospital.
- Now he's had his third breakdown. The worst. He started hearing voices in his head, and then he started seeing devils. It's gonna take at least a year to cure the poor guy. Just remember, in the local hospital. In Kiev he'll die at once.
- Deal. - Bibik gave a sign to special troops.
Soldiers took Scout under hands, ducked and dragged him to the ambulance. One of the remaining Special Forces men helped Tatiana barely alive with fatigue to cope with the wind blown by the helicopter blades and came to Old with Bibik.
- Welcome back, Madam. - The Colonel smiled. - How's the mood?
- Shitty. - Tatiana looked at Bibik indifferently.
- Wow, how the scientists are talking! - The Colonel laughed. - Where's your academic style?
- You can't describe it all to them. - Tatiana glanced at the piled corpses of mutants by the wall of the southern warehouse. - Is it possible to fall down and die somewhere here, too? Not next to the mutants.
- Why die here? - Bibic gestured to the nearest warehouse. - Here you go! Showers, clean uniforms, a modest dinner, and a leather couch. All at your service.
- And the couch? - Tatiana firmly grabbed Old by the shoulder. - Andrei, tell me this is not another silly joke!
- Not a joke. - Old looked condescendingly at Bibik. - And if it is a joke, it's really foolish.
- So do good to people! - The colonel sighed with feigned sadness. - You are to them with a soul, and they try to offend! Move! It's all true. You get cleaned up, go upstairs to the first floor, to the chief's office for coffee and dessert. Third door on the left... or the fourth... ...you'll find...
...It took two hours to clean up and have a modest dinner. However, neither Bibik nor Ostapenko scolded the walkers for their sluggishness. The general was glowing with uncharacteristic kindness and Bibik brewed natural coffee and kindly poured thirty drops of "five star" into it. Given the military-field conditions and the extreme exhaustion of both sides, such a reception could well be considered chic. As a reciprocal gesture Andrew did not crumple his report and painted the raid and all the difficulties falling on the heads of the walkers in the brightest colours. Of course, as much as he could.
When Andrew finished recounting his version of events, the ancient wall clock in the former office of the head of the warehouse complex, now Ostapenko's temporary office, struck midnight. The pedantic general cast a brief glance at his wrist chronometer and nodded contentedly. It was unclear whether he was satisfied with the accuracy of the antique chronometer or with Old's story, but the satisfied grimace stuck firmly to Ostapenko's face. Even when the General said he felt sorry for Brazhnikov and the Mechanic, his expression did not change.
- And I feel sorry for Scout," muttered Bibik in the corner. - Or just hurt... I don't know. We ain't without eyes, we've seen through it! So many years that traitor was hanging around, trying to be his own man, even confessing his cowardice, and I felt sorry for him, and that's the way it turned out.
- Scout not to blame, - softly intervened Tatiana. - Andrew, tell them.
Old man briefly glanced at the nestled in a leather armchair friend and reluctantly nodded.
- In general, yes, not his fault that six years ago he was almost in the epicenter of the Second Catastrophe. The outbreak had changed him, like Olga, not outwardly, but only inwardly. To put it mildly, they had both become mutants after all, but only hidden. To put it crudely, one and the other became the same zombies, but only, so to speak, in a lightened version and with the rudiments of telepathic abilities. They both lived off the Zone. If they had gone further out into the outside world, they would have died at once from causes unknown to normal medicine. That's what Scout feared. Not of the Zone, but of being excommunicated. And exposure. Any stalker would have killed him on the spot if he'd known Scout was a latent mutant. The enemy had promised him to find a way, if not to get rid of his addiction, at least to increase his resilience outside the Zone. And Scout believed the Engineer, but didn't understand that it was about expansion and turning the whole world into a Zone. And when he did, it was too late.
- Wow. - Bibik sighed. - You were a dead man, then? But he ate vodka like he was alive. And when he was wounded, he nearly died for real.
- In the Zone he was alive, like all of us, - tiredly objected Tatiana. - And betrayed because he was deceived by the Engineer.
- You naive sheep! - Bibik cracked his fist on the armrest of his chair. - I will not forgive you!
- And it is not necessary, - said Ostapenko calmly. - So, Olga is a hidden mutant too? So why did you let her go?
- And why not? - The old man shrugged his shoulders. - Olga made the right choice and helped to destroy the Engineer, though it cost her a lot of moral effort. To kill a monster so much like her father... hats off to her personally. After all, her generation doesn't know that Pavlik Morozov is a hero. By all accounts, she should have opted for the enemy. But she didn't - so she's thinking straight.
- The mutant, even if he thinks rightly for the time being, will sooner or later reveal his essence," the General objected with a frown. - If Olga finds the entrance to the Thirteenth Sector again, the metamorphosis is bound to happen.
- She won't," Bibik muttered. - In Chernobyl-2 the entrance is closed, in other places too. There were no entrances, only exits, you said yourself. My scouts have checked everything. Pashkov reported five minutes ago. The sector is completely isolated.
- All right, if it is so. - Ostapenko glanced at the Colonel, who got in at the wrong time. - But at the headquarters they would be sure to show me both the fact that Stariy let the potential enemy go, and the fact that the crystal had disappeared to no-one knows where.
- Checking? - Andrew grinned. - "I can tell you again: the crystal, aka the artifact of the Key kind, is still in the Thirteenth sector.
- Yeah," Ostapenko grinned crookedly. - You stuffed it down the monster's throat to turn it inside out, then picked up the crystal and threw it into the Contact Point, didn't you?
He suddenly turned to Tatiana and stared at her with extreme suspicion.
- Yes," she blurted out in surprise.
- No," hastened to help her help Andrew. - And do not take us to the gun, General.
- And who takes whom? - Ostapenko was falsely astonished. - I just want to hear - yes or no.
- No. We didn't take anything to the "spot of contact". And we couldn't if we wanted to. First of all, it was a clean exit from the sector, there's no way back through the hole. Secondly, even if the passage had been reversible, it would have closed the instant the monster had died. The crystal simply disappeared at the same time as the Engineer died. That's why I figured it fell where it belonged, or evaporated... I don't know what happened to it, but the Key is gone. I don't dug around too hard in the monster's remains, but I'm a hundred percent sure it's gone.
- My scouts dug around," said Beaker again. - "There ain't nothing there. Just stinking guts.
Andrei silently pointed at the colonel. Ostapenko smirked enigmatically again, but pretended to finally believe him.
- It was all the more dangerous to let Olga go. She'd get into the sector by accident, and everything was ready for the new arrival there. The "failed" crystal was there, and monsters, and abnormal energy would be accumulated... enough for the Third Catastrophe. This sector is a mine, a bloody mine!
- Stop grumbling, Mister General. - The old man ran his palm across his face tiredly. - Two prerequisites are required for a new brew, a crystal and an Engineer. Both things are unique, and both are out of the picture. Even if Olga were to follow in her father's footsteps... she won't get into the sector. Relax.
- Well, about relaxing, that's more to show you. - Ostapenko looked condescendingly at Tatiana and then at Andrei.
- It would be nice, if you do not mind. - Lunev shook his head, as if in response to his thoughts. - But I still have one question. Until I get the answer, I can not relax.
- Ask.
- How did you know?
- About what?
- About the Engineer and Olga.
- Oh, that. - Ostapenko grinned. - It's a secret of the firm, Andrei. I'm a counterintelligence officer, remember?
- I remember. Only I have little faith in your firm's mystical powers. If you were as you want to seem, the Engineer would have been on the dole long ago. And Olga wouldn't have been traded away like a pawn.
- We'd have to, Andrei, we'd have to. Otherwise there was no way to get close to the Engineer. Without Olga in the group, he would have destroyed you before you even entered the Thirteenth Sector. And with her, you became of interest to the enemy. He even let you into his lair. Are you saying I miscalculated the situation?
- You calculated it correctly, like a computer. And just as soulless. Olga, by the way, is a living person. And you fed her to that monster as if she were a poisoned piece of meat!
- She's a mutant.
- A human being! - Andrew shook his head. - Not like us physically, but in the soul... Maybe even more human than you!
- Words, words... - Ostapenko grimaced. - Let you rest then we will continue this argument. If you want to. As for the abilities of our firm, I'll be sure to let you in on all the secrets, Andrew, I promise.
- I don't give a damn about your secrets. - Andrei waved his hand tiredly. - I don't give a shit about your company either.
- All right then. - Ostapenko nodded. - You are dismissed. I won't disturb you for a day. And the day after tomorrow... Andrei, be a dear, come in, we need to talk.
- Stop! - Lunev, despite his fatigue, raised his hand sharply. - One more word and you'll be looking for me in Australia! No more contracts! I'm fed up, I'm sorry.
- I don't insist. - The General put on a sympathetic face. - No, that means no! Just come in and we'll talk. If we agree, I promise I won't bother you for at least a month. Honeymoon.
- And if you don't? - The old man glanced at the general sideways.
- Then no. - Ostapenko met his gaze. - Only I think you will come in. You will be out of business without me, and you will not live long without business, like Scout without the Zone. You don't have the temperament.
- No promises. - Andrey stood up and gave his hand to Tatiana. - Nothing!.When the door closed behind the couple, Ostapenko and Bibik glanced at each other.
- Will he come back? - With concealed hope asked Bibik.
- A hundred percent," Ostapenko answered confidently. - I think we've had enough of exams, it's time to move on to the real business.
- And I told you right away that the guy is good for it! - The colonel rubbed his hands. - Now let's turn around!
- Take it easy, Bibic, take it easy. - The general patted the table. - Nobody's turning anywhere yet. We're resting and preparing the operation. Like I said, a month. God willing, everything will work out, then we'll turn around. You're free, too, for now.
- You got it! - Bibik rose vigorously from his chair and bows. - I have the honour! And so help us... The Zone...Lately the ancient mossy pier and the dilapidated wharf had become something of a must-see for Olga, if she wandered into Pripyat. She did not understand why this was so, and she did not try to understand it. She just liked it here. Sitting on the greenish rough stones, looking out over the water and not thinking about anything. Nirvana.
No, she couldn't think at all. Just two steps behind, on the other side of the dense thicket, a ruined city teemed with anomalous life, and she had to keep her ears open, but still, Olga felt calmer and more comfortable here than in the most secure shelter. Perhaps the calmness was inspired by the gentle lapping of the waves, or perhaps by the knowledge that she could simply swim away from mutants or evil people at any moment... Olga could find no clear explanation for the peacefulness that enveloped her in this place.
In the depths, at the bottom of the familiar underwater pit, a huge shadow stirred, and Olga shook off her drowsy stupor for a moment. Olga's old acquaintance, the giant catfish, was still alive and well, though it had developed quite a few competitors in the cooling pond and the Pripyat. Rumours of several new species of aquatic mutants had spread across the Zone as recently as three months ago, and Olga had seen for herself that it was true. Overgrown tritons, leeches with piranha ambitions, five-meter long snakes with crocodile-like mouths - all these creatures successfully explored the zone water area. However, the giant catfish remained in its rightful place, and this fact pleased Olga for some reason. Probably because she was tired of the rapid changes in the Zone, and she desperately wanted to hold on to something stable, unchanging, despite all the anomalous laws of local crazy nature. She wanted to cling to something that vaguely resembled Olga herself... as she had been before the raid in the Thirteenth Sector.
Catfish was quite suitable. He had changed only once, probably back during the Second Disaster, and had stubbornly ignored all the Zone's new "tempting offers" ever since. Though it could hardly offer him anything more. He had already acquired something that was beyond the limits of the fish's wildest dreams. He was the biggest fish in the small pond and had no problem feeding. There was plenty of biomass in the Zone, and much of it was deposited at the bottom of the cooling pond. What else did a catfish need to be happy?
Olga grinned incredulously.
"Fish dreams... What nonsense! What dreams can these brainless creatures have? On the other hand, in the figurative sense, my dreams could easily be called "fishy" too. I am trapped in the Zone forever, and now I need no more to be happy than this catfish. Food, water, and oxygen. No prospects, and therefore no aspirations. What am I after that, not a fish or something? I suppose I could think of other things to do, like the Stalkers, or I could plot, like my father did. No, not Dad, the monster in his guise. But why? Unlike him, I don't want the Zone everywhere. And I can find no other motivation to weave intrigue. So that leaves..."
A loud splash prevented Olga from finishing her thought. A high wave hit the parapet. The catfish's shadow suddenly increased sharply, and Olga could clearly see the huge smooth back of the monster surfacing to the surface. The girl shook her legs, getting ready to jump away, but for some reason changed her mind. The catfish hovered a meter from the surface, barely moving its fins. Its whiskers, long and thick, like the tentacles of a gigantic octopus, moved gently as if stirring the water under the fish's belly. The movements of the monster's whiskers were mesmerizing. Olga even held her breath.
A kind of "freeze frame" lasted for about a minute. Then the catfish suddenly lay on its left side and began to dive quickly. Olga exhaled, and just at that moment the huge whisker of the fish rose above the surface of the water. It slapped loudly on the pier to Olga's left and quickly slipped into the water like a lash. If it had struck a little to the right, no doubt the brooding young lady would have been nothing but a wet spot.
The most sensible thing would have been to rush away from the shore before the catfish tried again to get his lunch, but Olga did not move. The catfish was not hunting, she knew that for sure. The girl wiped the cold spray from her face with her sleeve and slowly turned her head to the left.
Catfish weren't hunting, one hundred percent. And about fish being mindless creatures, Olga was now ready to argue. They might be primitive creatures in the waters of the Great Land, but in the Zone...
Olga hesitantly reached out her hand to a large lump of mud and with two fingers pulled a silver chain with a large crystal suspended from it. The artifact's milky white glow was faint, but she couldn't help but recognize it. It was the same artifact the Engineer had used to turn the space of the Zone inside out. The key to Sector Thirteen and at the same time... to the whole world.
Olga's first wish was to unwind the crystal on a chain over her head and toss it away again into the pond, but she imagined what would happen next and changed her mind. Sooner or later she would return to this pier and the catfish would repeat its trick. The inevitable will happen, the destined cannot be erased.
Olga thoughtfully rubbed the chain, then removed the remnants of the slime from it, hung the crystal around her neck and stood up. Where she would go and what she would do, Olga did not know. It did not matter yet. For a start, go ahead. And then she would see. The Zone will definitely tell her the right decision. It would. As it always has...</text>

	<text>Terrorist attack in Beslan</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_anomaly_jarka">
	<text>On September 1, 2004, the world was shaken by the news of the siege of a school building in the North Ossetian town of Beslan by terrorists. On that day, a terrorist group, led by Rasul Khachbarov, and numbering more than 30 people, seized the building of Secondary General School No. 1. During a festive assembly in the school yard, the armed men opened fire over the heads of those present and started to drive all those present into the building. Using the panic, only a few managed to escape the fate of the hostages. For three days, terrorists held more than a thousand people - children, their parents and school staff - inside the school building. For more than 50 hours, the terrorists denied them water, food and necessary medication. Any attempts to negotiate with the terrorists in a constructive manner and to resolve the issue of the release of the hostages without force proved to be unsuccessful. The only person who the guerrillas agreed to let into the school building on September 2nd was the former president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev. The latter managed to persuade the guerrillas to let only 25 women and small children go with him. On September 3rd a spontaneous operation to free the hostages was carried out. "More than 350 people, including children, local residents and Russian FSB personnel, were killed in a terrorist attack in Beslan. The rest of the hostages (over 560 people), in addition to the injuries they received during the storming of the school building, suffered a severe psychological shock. Thirty-one terrorists were killed, one was detained and later sentenced to life imprisonment - Nurpasha Kulayev. On September 17, 2004, Shamil Basayev publicly claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack in Beslan. The school building after the liberation operation, and as a result of the terrorists' explosives, was almost completely destroyed. One year after that tragic event, a monument, the Tree of Sorrow, was unveiled at the Beslan Memorial Cemetery, where the victims of the terrorist attack are buried.</text>

	<text>The OZM-72 anti-personnel high-explosive circular jumping mine (also known as "frog mine"). It was developed in the Soviet Union. It is deciphered as a fragmentation obstacle mine. Its origin goes from the German jumping mine SMI-44 during the Second World War. On actuation of the fuse (fuse is MUV 4), fire ignites a gunpowder retarder, which ignites the powder charge through the central ignition tube. The latter ejects the warhead from the cup to a height of about 0.6 to 0.8 m. The mine is triggered after bouncing under the action of the tension rope, one end of which is fixed to the bottom of the mine and the other to the inner wedge-shaped lock, which actuates the fuse, detonating the warhead, it is one of the design differences from the US analog - M-16 mine, which uses pyrotechnic retarder. If the mine fails to take off at the correct altitude, there is no detonation at all, however, the use of a tension rope increases the reliability of the ammunition. Defeat is achieved by the use of prefabricated projectiles (2,400 rollers or balls). As of 2010 it is in service in Russia.</text>

	<text>It took seven years to get it into production
King Abdullah II Ben Al-Hussein of Jordan and Sergei Chemezov, CEO of the Russian Technologies State Corporation, officially opened an assembly plant for the RPG-32 Nashshab grenade launcher in Jordan on May 30, 2013. The assembly plant is owned by Jadara Equipment & Defence Systems, aka Jordanian Russian Electronic Systems Co.
It took seven years to put the RPG-32 into production. During this time it became a legend and well known. It is no wonder, as it is considered the most powerful grenade launcher in the world - it can penetrate homogeneous armor up to one meter thick. Therefore, it is very interesting to learn the real history of its creation. To do it the correspondent of "Ímet with one of the main founders of this grenade launcher Vladimir Korenkov, former Director General - General Designer of SRPE "Bazalt".
A royal idea
At the Abu Dhabi arms exhibition in March 2005, three groups of interested persons met. The first was Jordanian, led by the King, and the second was high-ranking representatives of Rosoboronexport and the Federal Service for Military Technical Cooperation (FSMTC).
First there was a meeting with Jordanian generals who said they would be interested in taking part in some modern weapons development.
King Abdullah II places great emphasis on the development of knowledge-intensive products. The Jordanian national King Abdullah II Design and Development Bureau (KADDB), for example, focuses on the development of very high quality sighting devices from various countries. Not only that, but the Jordanians are even authorized users, i.e. they have the right to design or modify something themselves. On the tank front, a favourite subject of the King, a tank with an unmanned combat module instead of a turret has been developed in co-operation with South Africa. On the battlefield weapons and ammunition theme, however, there was nothing.
On the same day, all interested parties met in the consulting room of the Rosoboronexport pavilion. Within an hour Russian ammunition products were presented to the king and he was told about prospects and developments.
Says Vladimir Korenkov: "Abdullah II liked everything and after a while he expressed an interest in ordering development for Jordan and asked what the Russian side could offer? Immediately the idea of bicalibre was born.
Because it is not rational to carry a heavy grenade launcher, when only 10% of the targets on the battlefield require a 105 mm caliber. The rest are well solved by conventional shots of lesser mass. And immediately it was immediately coined the name RPG-32.
It is a very light grenade launcher, which at the same time is a case for the sighting device. And a system of sealed cartridges with shots of different calibers. Plus a good telescopic sight, which was supposed to be further developed as a fire control device.
But at the same time another idea was born - to promote this weapon in the markets, first of all in the Middle East, using rebranding. Russian weapons with equal quality have always been sold at half the price of foreign weapons. The only way to change it was to rebrand it, to offer this product from a different vendor."
The fundamentally new grenade launcher was made in just one year. This was promoted by serious scientific and technical background of "Bazalt" company and strong staff of designers. Difficulties were encountered in the "paperwork" part of the project - numerous approvals and preparation of documents for the intergovernmental agreement.
Bazalt had already had bad experiences with similar ventures in Bulgaria and India. They were literally drowned in bureaucratic procedures even at the initial stage.
Vladimir Korenkov is sure that without FSMTC head Mikhail Dmitriev and advisor Vladimir Poletov, neither the plant, nor the RPG-32 itself would have existed. Opposition to the project was felt from the very beginning, but it was quite unclear where it was coming from. Suffice it to say that the contract went into effect virtually upon completion of all design work. "Bazalt received payment after the RPG-32 was already ready.
All the development work was done through a presidential decree and the state intermediary Rosoboronexport. Its employees were very actively involved in preparation of all documents on the international part and coordination with departments. Especially noteworthy was the head of Rosoboronexport's department, Mikhail Bychkov.
The scheme for financing the work changed several times, first with the company's own funds, then with a loan. King was initially prepared to pay everything from his own funds. But in the end a state loan was obtained. At the same time, the idea of building a plant on land in Jordan took shape. A large-scale assembly was to be carried out there, with the possibility of further authorisation.
An internal tender was held to build the sight, and Belarusian BelOMO offered the best terms. And in the future, its staff promptly responded to all needs to change the characteristics of the sighting system. They did very well and for reasonable money. And now they continue to improve the sight, already in direct cooperation with Jordan.
Training equipment
Simultaneously with the combat model of the RPG-32, a complex with practical training equipment was made. Previously, training equipment included posters, cut-out mock-ups, command boxes, etc. At Bazalt, a grenade launcher firing inertial rounds, which cost very little, fell into this category. The fact is that the companies were given the right to conduct foreign economic activities in the field of service and training simulators, systems and complexes.
"Basalt took advantage of this opportunity by creating a new product. As a result, by 2009, the company's export orders for training rounds exceeded orders for military products. It was the same with the state defence order. The combat reflexes gained by using this type of training and combat weapons are exactly the same. Everything is the same, except for the possibility of barotrauma to the shooter. While the combat shot is a shock of about 160 decibels, effectively a light concussion, the training shot is 135-140 decibels, which is almost painless to bear and allows you to continue training shooting. There is no accumulation of hearing injuries and real firing skills are built up. This property is very highly valued by foreign military specialists. It is not only about RPG-32, the training equipment was developed for almost the whole line of Russian grenade launchers: RPG-22, RPG-26, RPG-29, RShG-1, etc.
A large batch of training equipment was manufactured, including RPG-32, about 10 thousand rounds. There were deliveries to Jordan, to domestic special units for training. But that was the end of training equipment production at Bazalt. And this market is now virtually lost.
The reason for this was a review of the production and design plans by Bazalt's new management. Vladimir Korenkov was dismissed from his position as director general at the end of April 2009. He did not want to be the general director himself, knowing that the enterprise was going to be restructured and the design work was going to be reduced.
The state defense order for inert shots was given to the Planta plant. They used a different technology: they would receive items from the arsenal of the Ministry of Defense, disassemble them, reassemble and supply to the army again at a price of 80% of the new product. The same ammunition, but without a fuse or explosive. In other words, the army would lose a serviceable product, and would have to pay for it again, in order to obtain an inert one. For the same money, Basalt could supply five times the amount of training equipment without the loss of arsenals.
DutyOstroy
The assembly plant in Jordan should have been operational by the autumn of 2009. In April 2009, when Vladimir Korenkov left Bazalt, all activity in this area came to a halt.
But the Russian-Jordanian agreement was still in force, and the plant was supposed to be built. In March 2010 King Abdullah II of Jordan, accompanied by his Hashemite counterpart Samir al-Rifai, and Foreign Minister Nasser Joda, arrived in Moscow to discuss military-technical cooperation. Following talks with President Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in April, new export agreements were signed. This includes the establishment of assembly production of RPG-32 grenade launchers in Jordan under new conditions...
RPG-32 as it is
Vladimir Porhachev either misspoke or did not know that there is no "Hashim" now, but "Nashshab". Incidentally, the RPG "Hashim" was named after the great-grandfather of the Prophet Mohammed, the benefactor of Mecca, Hashim ibn Abd al-Dar, from whom the royal family of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan traces its origin. The name was given to the grenade launcher by Abdullah II himself. "Nashshab" can be translated as "shatterer", "shredder" or "crusher". Whichever one prefers. By the way, quite in the spirit of oriental traditions, where weapons have always been given a frightening name.
The estimated production capacity of the assembly plant, located 20 kilometers from the capital of Amman, is 60,000 grenade launchers a year. If there will be such requests from buyers, of course. So far 80% of components will be supplied from Russia. In the future an increase in the localization level is expected.
Bazalt claims it had to modify the RPG-32 including its exterior. However, no details of the revisions are given. A comparison of 2006 and 2013 samples, their photos and videos shows that the Nashshab is exactly the same as the Hashim.
The RPG-32 remained in the range version. Instead of camouflage, it has exhibition stars. It is still wearing a technological white cap. And these are all demasking elements. Judging by this the grenade launcher has not undergone any modifications. Therefore we can quote its specifications as unchanged.
So, RPG-32 "Nashshab" is a multi-purpose manual multi-caliber multi-purpose grenade launcher. Depending on the type of target it can be equipped with 72.5 mm or 105 mm rounds. The 36 cm long and 3 kg long launcher is fitted with a folding iron sights. The range of accurate shot is 700 m. The launching system is electric, but without battery or accumulator. The electric pulse is generated by a special generator, which increases the reliability of the grenade launcher.
The 72mm caliber grenade is designed to engage lightly armored targets, shelters, etc., penetrates armor 500mm thick. The weight of the grenade is 3 kg. The 105-mm hollow-point grenade penetrates homogeneous armor with a thickness of about 1000 millimeters and weighs 7 kg. The grenades are contained in special sealed and shockproof cartridges. The grenade launcher can withstand up to 200 rounds without loss of firepower. The RPG-32 is very easy to handle, any beginner can master it very easily and from the second shot is guaranteed to hit the target. It is enough to catch the target in the sight and fire.
The RPG-32 has not yet been adopted by Russian army. And it will never be adopted. As at the moment Russia is developing a new grenade launcher system, which is likely to destroy armored vehicles as a class. The tender for its development for the RF Defence Ministry was won by the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. The tender for its creation was won by the Bauman Moscow State Technical University through the efforts of the university's Research and Production Centre Special Technology. The centre is headed by Vladimir Korenkov. He found support and understanding here. The scientific director of the new structural unit is Victor Selivanov, doctor of technical sciences. They are in a hurry to implement breakthrough ideas. They are in a hurry to arm Russia with absolute battlefield weapons. What they have achieved, we will know in a year or two.</text>

	<text>Vityaz.</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_anomaly_mar_b5_doc_10">
	<text>This past Wednesday, 19 June, Russian President V. Putin, accompanied by Defence Minister S. Shoigu, St Petersburg Governor G. Poltavchenko and other dignitaries, visited the Obukhov plant in St Petersburg, which is involved in several contracts under the state defence order. The officials were shown one of the production halls of the plant where machines of the new anti-aircraft missile system "Vityaz" were located. After visiting the production site, the President held a meeting devoted to the current state and prospects of Russian air and space defense systems.
The demonstrated equipment was of particular interest. The Vityaz SAM system was first captured by photo and TV cameras, which immediately attracted wide attention of the interested public. The complex developed by the Almaz-Antey concern will replace some modifications of S-300P family systems in the near future. "The Vityaz is intended for anti-aircraft defense of stationary objects and is capable of engaging targets at short and medium ranges. It is noted that Vityaz uses the same medium-range missiles as the S-400 anti-aircraft system.
The Obukhov plant, a structural subdivision of the Almaz-Antey concern, produces the launchers for the new SAM system. All the units are mounted on eight-wheeled chassis produced by the Bryansk Automobile Plant. In addition to the vehicle equipped with the missile launcher, the anti-aircraft system includes a command post and an all-round radar station. The characteristics of the Vityaz have not yet been made public, but representatives of the developer are talking about the forthcoming replacement of the S-300 complexes of earlier models. This gives a rough idea of the capabilities of the new SAM.
After the demonstration deployment of the complex systems, which took place right in the workshop, the president was invited into the cabin of one of the vehicles. There Putin inspected the equipment and asked a few questions to the engineers who developed the project. During the demonstration of the Vityaz complex, Almaz-Antey Director General Vladimir Menshchikov spoke about the fate of the new development. According to him, an agreement has already been reached with the Ministry of Defense and missile tests will begin this year. Thus, the new SAM will go to the troops within the next few years.
At the meeting, which followed the small "exhibition", Vladimir Putin stressed the importance of the ongoing work. Putin stressed the importance of the ongoing work. He recalled that the opinion of the so-called first disarming strike is becoming more and more frequent. According to the president, the military and the defence industry should take into account the possibility of such events when developing the armed forces. About 3.4 trillion rubles will be allocated to develop aerospace defense, which is one of the top priorities, by 2020. This will make it possible to improve the capabilities of the troops that defend the country's airspace as well as get ready to respond to possible threats.
It was noted at the meeting that the development of air defense, and not "classic" air defense is in some ways a forced measure. The fact is that the states in the neighbouring countries are actively pursuing medium-range ballistic missiles and Russia needs to take this into account. Our country once refused to build and operate such systems, but medium-range missiles are of great interest to some of our neighbours. For this reason, there is a need for defences capable of countering such threats.
Work on the creation and construction of new air defence and air defence systems is already under way, and some of the results of these programmes will be shown to the public in just a couple of months. According to Putin, the Russian defence industry will showcase the latest versions of some aerospace defence systems at the upcoming MAKS-2013 international air show in Zhukovsky. At the same time, the President did not specify the specific type of equipment planned for display.
Speaking about serial production of the new equipment, Putin said that bureaucracy and red tape are the main obstacles to the construction of anti-aircraft systems. However, in spite of these problems, production and design work has to go according to the schedule. For deadlines, delays and the like the relevant leaders should be held personally responsible. It is noteworthy that a bill introducing personal financial penalties for negligent officials and merchants has already been introduced in the State Duma. Under this draft law, responsible persons who failed to fulfill the State Defense Order will pay fines, and various restrictions will be imposed on organizations.
During the meeting, the President reminded of the main objectives pursued by the current state rearmament programme. The air and space defence forces must renovate their equipment by half by 2015 and by 70% by 2020. The realisation of such plans requires the renewal of production facilities and the improvement of their performance. Certain measures are already being taken for this purpose, and the Obukhov plant is no exception.
To improve efficiency of the Obukhov plant and a number of related enterprises the Northwest Regional Center is being established within the Almaz-Antey Air Defense Concern, which will include five factories in St. Petersburg. Putin said that such a measure would make it possible to optimize production costs and transportation processes. It is the Obukhov plant that will play the leading role in this merger. In addition, reconstruction of the plant is now underway, which should result in renewal of production capacities and, as a consequence, increased capabilities. The first results of all these works are already visible. Thus, in the current year of 2013, the Obukhov plant was able to conclude contracts within the framework of the State Defense Order for a total amount of 12 billion rubles. Last year, this figure was four times less.
Among the new types of equipment, the production of which will start at the renewed enterprises in the near future, will be the new anti-aircraft missile system Vityaz. The approximate deadline for its acceptance for service is 2016. Exact dates will become clear later when the tests of individual elements and the whole complex will be completed...</text>

	<text>Many states of the world currently have modern nuclear weapons in their stockpiles. Naturally, all types of nuclear weapons can be categorized. For example, nuclear weapons (taken from http://nuclear-weapon.ru/) include: artillery which uses nuclear warheads; submarines; nuclear mines. Each of the aforementioned munitions, in turn, is differentiated by their power. They are conventionally divided into: super-small, small, medium, large, and also, super-large.
The type of any ammunition depends entirely on its purpose and design. Every live ammunition of this nature has special indentations on its casing that can be used to check the serviceability of the automatic nuclear charging system. Training charges are specifically marked, and in some countries, the containers carrying nuclear weapons are marked with a specific colour. Pakistan has also developed this type of weapon.
When the development of nuclear weapons began in many countries, Pakistan also developed a special nuclear program. This happened in the seventies. In fact, this program was aimed at making nuclear weapons using uranium. As the available evidence states, this state has special technological capabilities of a fairly high class in order to produce nuclear devices of a certain weight and power in an accelerated manner. A fairly objective condition for confirmation of this aspect is the fact that Pakistan is independent in providing special fissile substances, for in many of its regions there are large reserves of uranium ores necessary for this purpose. In addition, many sources report that Pakistani scientists have begun to take a direct interest in using plutonium to make nuclear warheads.
Importantly, the country has all the essential conditions for the success of the above-mentioned programme. The country has the necessary scientific staff and modern technology, which is used to enrich uranium as much as possible. In addition, a plant in a large city not only provides nuclear fuel for the plants, but also creates new supplies - directly for future plants. In fact, the nuclear programme here, under the influence of such important factors, is developing successfully and further...</text>

This is how he commented on some media reports that the Su-25UTG made its first flight from the ship's aviation test simulator.
Today there were two MiG-29KUB test sorties, during which the aircraft made a simulated landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier. The flights will continue for a fortnight. There will be about ten sorties," the agency's interlocutor said.
He stressed that the main purpose of the flights is to check the lighting and technical equipment of the simulator deck. In particular, the Saturn, Luna-37 and MTK-201 complexes will be assessed. The test flights are carried out by pilots of the RSK MIG, the Southern Military District has only provided airspace for the tests, a representative of the district said.
Earlier, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Viktor Chirkov told RIA Novosti that the Russian simulator in Yeisk will start functioning at the turn of 2013-2014. Spetsstroy director Grigory Naginsky told the agency that the aircraft will start flying on the Russian simulator in September-August 2013.
The NITKA (Ground Test Aviation Training Complex) aviation simulator is used to train pilots of deck aviation. This simulator is an airfield with a steel flight field in the form of a ship deck, equipped with a ramp and air finishers. The dimensions of the airfield are equivalent to those of the flight deck of the heavy aircraft carrier cruiser Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov. The only Nitka complex created in the USSR is at the Novofedorovka airfield (near the town of Saki in the Crimea). After the collapse of the USSR the complex was transferred to Ukraine.</text>

	<text>The newest fifth-generation aircraft is equipped with a unique system for pilot breathing
Russia's fifth-generation Sukhoi T-50 fighter jet has been equipped with an unlimited oxygen supply system for the pilot's mask. It is required for flights over 4 km. Without oxygen, a pilot falls asleep and looses consciousness. All existing Russian combat aircraft supply oxygen from cylinders, which run out sooner or later. The T-50 produces oxygen from the air using a special system developed by the Research and Production Enterprise Zvezda.
- Oxygen here is produced from the air, the system takes it from the engine compressor and feeds it into the pilot's breathing mask. Flight time no longer depends on oxygen supply, and the pilot may fly with several refuellings, in contrast to the existing aircraft, where the pilot has to keep checking that he has not run out of oxygen before fuel," Mikhail Dudnik, chief specialist with the NPP Zvezda, told Izvestia.
According to him, in addition to an unlimited amount of oxygen, the system also saves the payload of the combat vehicle - the entire oxygen generating unit weighs about 30 kg, whereas the oxygen cylinders for two hours of flight weigh 90 kg.
- This is mainly important for fighter aircraft, where space and weight are always in short supply and where it is not possible to store oxygen in large quantities, as on large bombers," Dudnik explained.
According to him, the system has been developed over the past five years and is now installed on four prototype T-50 aircraft, which are being tested in the Moscow region.
- The first prototype T-50s, which are made in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, flew on their own, and they had to refuel, of course, but they did not need to replenish the oxygen supply," Dudnik explained.
No modern aircraft can do without oxygen - there is nothing to breathe at altitudes above 4 km. And while for a passenger or transport aircraft the presence of cumbersome cylinders on board is practically imperceptible, for a fighter, where every centimetre and gramme is calculated, the 60kg weight reduction is very significant.
On the basis of the BKDU for the T-50 fighter, a similar system has been created for the Russian Air Force Yak-130 combat trainer; this year, the MiG-29K deck fighters will also receive an oxygen system. Having assessed the advantages of such systems, the Algerian and Malaysian armies have already ordered them for their Su-30 fighters.
- The first Yak-130 prototypes had a conventional air unit with cylinders," recalls test pilot Roman Taskaev. - In 1999, we transported such a Yak-130 to the Aermacchi factory in Italy. We took enough oxygen to cover the whole flight, but due to partial depressurisation of the cylinders, the oxygen consumption increased and we had to refuel at the Bratislava airfield. With the new system there will be no such problems.
In the Russian army, oxygen is traditionally "produced" on the ground. This process requires trained staff and sophisticated special equipment. If the technology is not used properly, there is a risk of an explosion.
- Battalions of airborne technical support now include oxygen extraction vehicle stations," former Air Force Commander Anatoly Kornukov told Izvestia. - Their maintenance needs soldiers and sergeants, who have six months of training in this specialty, and officers generally receive five years of training. Because of the high fire hazard of oxygen, the selection for these specialties is very rigorous.
According to Kornukov, the new oxygen system will help reduce the number of airfield staff and increase the long-range effectiveness of the fighters. There will also be no problems at field airfields, where there is no oxygen extraction equipment.
The On-Board Oxygen Delivery Station system, designated OBOGS, is also available in the US Army - fifth-generation F-22 aircraft and F-18 deck fighters are equipped with it.</text>

	<text>CAMTO, July 17. At the Tsabal mountain range in Abkhazia, air defense units of the Russian military base held training exercises to repel enemy air strikes, the press service of the Southern Military District reported.
A total of 100 servicemen took part in the exercise and dozens of units of weapons, military and special equipment were involved.
In mountainous and wooded terrain, anti-aircraft missile units practised capturing, escorting and simulated destruction of single and grouped aerial targets of the simulated enemy.
Particular attention was paid to the practical development of the newest mobile small-size three-coordinate radar station (radar) Harmon, which arrived at the unit at the end of last year.
The new radar provides detection and tracking of various objects in the air, identification of their nationality, and automatic issuance of route information to automated control systems.
The small size and weight of the station ensures its prompt delivery to the destination point, including in hard-to-access and mountainous terrain.
In the course of the training exercise, the issues of occupying starting positions on the move, camouflaging them, organising the communication and control system, and bringing equipment from the marching position to the combat position were practised. The personnel also carried out a number of missions involving reconnaissance, detection, escort and destruction of enemy targets.
In the near future a tactical exercise with live firing will be held at the firing range in the Krasnodar Territory, in late summer specialists of the air defense of the compound will take part in a tactical special exercise at the Kapustin Yar range (Astrakhan Region), according to the press service of the Southern Military District.</text>

	<text>CAMTO, 18 July. The Air Force of Vietnam is contemplating acquisition of mobile solid-state digital two-coordinate radars RV-01 "Vostok-Eh" of meter-range produced in Belarus.
These radars can effectively detect modern low-observable fighters, including the J-20 being developed in China. The station is characterized by enhanced jamming protection, stealth, reliability and mobility.
Several Vietnamese and Taiwanese resources quoted Russian sources as saying that the Radar Design Bureau (KB Radar OJSC) developed in Belarus is to replace outdated Soviet-era P-18 radars in the Vietnamese Air Force.
According to the developers, the Vostok-E radar is capable of detecting small fighters, including US F-117A, under jamming conditions at a range of 74 km, and up to 350 km in their absence.
Sources say that Belarus plans to sell about 20 Vostok-E radars to the Vietnamese Armed Forces, and send advisors to train troops in the use of the new equipment. A group of Vietnamese specialists has already been trained in Belarus in June this year.
Experts believe the strengthening of military-technical cooperation with Belarus will enable Vietnam to diversify imports by countries supplying weapons of mass destruction.</text>

	<text>Irkut Corporation is developing the Su-30SM programme
The State Flight Test Center named after V.P. Chkalov of the Russian Ministry of Defence (Akhtubinsk, Astrakhan Oblast) has signed a preliminary agreement with Irkut Corporation (a part of United Aircraft Corporation) for a special joint flight test of the Su-30SM multi-role, two-seat fighter.
Unique capabilities
"The Su-30SM aircraft will significantly enhance the combat capabilities of the Russian Air Force," Colonel Sergei Kobylash, aviation chief - deputy commander-in-chief of the Air Force for aviation, Hero of Russia, said. "The Su-30SM's ability to simultaneously detect and engage multiple targets and its super manoeuvrability are unique. The modern fighters will be delivered to the Air Force not as single specimens but as whole squadrons," he said.
In turn, Oleg Demchenko, President of OAO Irkut Corporation, stressed that Irkut Corporation, working in close cooperation with Sukhoi, will do its best to fulfill the state contract for the delivery of Su-30SM fighters on time.
The multifunctional Su-30SM fighter is the further development of the Su-30MK family of combat aircraft. Sukhoi's specialists have adapted the fighter to meet the requirements of the Russian Air Force in terms of radar, radio communication and state identification systems, ejection seat and a number of support systems. Changes have also been made to the armament. The first contract for the delivery of Su-30SM multi-role fighters was signed by the Russian Ministry of Defence and OAO Irkut Corporation last spring.
First flight
"Industry Weekly" has already written that one of the most significant achievements in the life of Russian mechanical engineering last year was the success of the Su-30SM programme. Notably, the first flight of this unique fighter was performed at the airfield of the Irkutsk Aviation Plant, a branch of Irkut Corporation, just before the celebration of the traditional Machine Builder's Day in Russia.
According to a joint press-release of Irkut and Sukhoi Design Bureau, the Su-30SM aeroplane in its maiden flight was piloted by test pilots of Sukhoi Design Bureau, with commander Sergey Kostin, class 1 test pilot, and navigator Pavel Malovechko, Russian merited test navigator. The flight lasted two hours and passed without any faults.
The multi-role Su-30SM fighter is a further development of the Su-30MK family of combat aircraft. Sukhoi Design Bureau specialists have adapted the fighter to the requirements of the Russian Air Force in the part of radar, radio communication and state identification systems, ejection seat and a number of support systems. Changes have also been made to the armament.
Prospective contract
As already mentioned, the contract to supply new fighters to the troops was signed last spring, in March 2012 to be exact. The contract provides for delivery of 30 Su-30SM multi-role fighters by 2015. As was widely reported in the media, the contract between the Russian Ministry of Defence and OAO Irkut Corporation has become a milestone in the life of the Russian aerospace industry, and also in strengthening the defence capabilities of the Russian Air Force.
While signing the document, a senior representative of the Russian Ministry of Defense said that the delivery of Su-30SM fighters, the latest ultra-maneuverable twin-seat fighters, will significantly increase the combat capabilities of the Russian Air Force. In addition, the technical capabilities of the plane will allow achieving a higher level of pilot training, which is especially important because of the increased volume of purchases of new generation combat aircraft.
The fact that the Russian Air Force is going to buy a batch of new Su planes was first mentioned during MAKS-2011 air show. Indeed, the state armament program for 2011-2020 envisages the delivery of Su-30SM fighters to the Air Force and Air Force of the Navy. Presumably, the Su-30SMs will be based at the Gvardeyskiy airfield in the Crimea, where they are to fully replace the Su-24 bombers currently stationed there. However, the contract signed in March turned out to be even bigger than planned - 30 planes instead of 28, and there was only talk about manning the Air Force.
Aircraft handover
The official handover of two Su-30SMs to the pilots of the Russian Air Force took place last autumn. Oleg Demchenko, president of OAO Irkut Corporation, commented then: "We have been working for exports for many years, and now we have started supplying the aircraft to the homeland. Nine of our Yak-130s are already flying at the Borisoglebsk training centre, and today we are handing over the first two Su-30SM fighters to the Russian Air Force. This is a historic event for our team, for Sukhoi, for the United Aircraft Corporation as a whole.
Alexander Kharchevsky, Head of Military Research and Training Centre of Air Force of Russian Federation, Air Force Academy named after professor N.E. Zhukovsky and Yu. Alexander Kharchevsky, who was present when the equipment was handed over, said, "The Su-30SM allow us to enhance the combat capabilities of the Russian Air Force. The renowned military pilot, who for many years headed the Centre of combat application and retraining of pilots of V.P. Chkalov Air Force and who has experience in piloting fighters of this type, noted the Su-30SM capabilities to detect and engage several targets simultaneously and its super manoeuvrability.
Technical details
The Su-30SM multirole super maneuverable fighter is a further development of the Su-30MK family of combat aircraft. This family is undoubtedly one of the most famous in world fighter aviation. A bit of history...
The Su-30MK multirole fighter produced by Irkut Corporation at Irkutsk Aviation Plant is one of the most advanced and sought-after fighters in the world. The Su-30MK from Irkut has become the world's first export fighter equipped with an airborne phased antenna array (PAA) radar, as well as the world's first commercial fighter with super manoeuvrability.
The Su-30MK has been in series production at the Irkutsk Aviation Plant since 2002. The Su-30MK programme has no rivals in the history of military and technical co-operation between Russia and other countries. The export of this fighter reaches hundreds (in pieces) and billions (in dollars).
The Su-30MK is designed to gain air superiority, intercept air targets, patrol and escort, as well as destroy ground and surface targets (suppress enemy air defense, block enemy actions from the air, and provide close air support). The aircraft can counter electronic warfare systems and perform long-range detection as well as provide operational control of a group of aircrafts in a joint mission. Owing to duplication of flight controls, the Su-30MK can be used for flight and combat training.
In technical terms, the Su-30SM, a development of the famous programme for the Russian Air Force, is a two-seat aircraft with thrust vectoring engines that provide it with supreme manoeuvrability. It is equipped with phased-array radar, can carry a wide variety of bomb-missile weapons and hit all types of air, land and sea targets. The aircraft is 21.9 m long, 6.36 m high; maximum take-off weight 34500 kg; maximum speed 2125 km/h; combat radius 1500 km. Combat load - 8000 kg.
Unlike its predecessors in the family, the Su-30SM avionics is based on the principle of open architecture, which simplifies the integration of new systems and weapons in the avionics. To quote one expert, the Su-30SM, with its unique combat characteristics to date, makes it possible to create compact air groups equally well suited to combat air, land and sea adversaries.
OAO "Irkut Scientific and Production Corporation" (a part of United Aircraft Corporation) is a vertically integrated holding company, focused on design, manufacture, sales, and after-sales support of military and civil aircraft.
The Corporation brings together leading domestic manufacturers and developers in the aircraft industry - the Irkutsk Aviation Plant, the Taganrog Aviation Research and Technological Complex named after G.M.Beriev. In March 2004, for the first time in the history of the Russian aviation industry, the Corporation consolidated the leading Russian aircraft manufacturers and developers.
In March 2004, for the first time in the history of Russian aircraft and military equipment production, Irkut successfully placed 23.3% of its shares (IPO) at an open stock exchange for domestic and foreign private and institutional investors. In November 2006, the Company became a part of the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC).
The Corporation employs more than 14,000 people, developing and manufacturing a wide range of high-tech products. The current order book exceeds $6 billion, with revenues doubling over the past five years. The Corporation accounts for over 15% of the Russian arms export market.
The Su-30 family of combat aircraft is Irkut's main product. The Company is the primary contractor of the Su-30MKI for the Indian Air Force. Under a product line diversification program, the Corporation is also developing and manufacturing Yak-130 combat training aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and components for Airbus passenger airliners. Recently, the Corporation has been actively working on the development of the MS-21 passenger aircraft.
Over the last seven years, the Corporation has been ranked among the world's top 100 defense industry leaders by the authoritative American publication Defense News. In 2007-2010, Irkut was named among the world's top 100 military-industrial companies by Defense News. "In 2007-2010 Irkut was named "Company of the Year" in the Industry. MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. In 2012 the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade named JSC Irkut Corporation as 'Russian Exporter of the Year' in the category 'Aircraft Building (Aircraft Construction)' for the fourth year in a row. The Irkutsk Aviation Plant (branch of Irkut Corporation) became the first in Russia to obtain the Airbus and EN9100 certification.</text>

	<text>CAMTO, July 10. Paraguay plans to sign a contract soon for the purchase of three new radars, each estimated to cost $14 million, the country's Defence Minister Maria Liz Garcia de Arnold said.
The delivery is expected to take place within 24 months of signing the contract, with payment over a 10-year period, Defensa.com reports.
Paraguay's Ministry of Defence has lobbied the country's parliament since November 2012 to purchase the new radar stations. The stations are planned to be located in Asuncion, Mariscal Estigarribia and Ciudad del Este.
According to national media reports, the Paraguayan Air Force has selected the EL/M-2082 L-band three-axis solid state phased antenna array radar from Israel's Elta Systems. The radars, which have a maximum detection range of 480km, can be used as part of the air defence and air traffic control system. The Paraguayan Air Force previously acquired two EL/M-2106NG radars from Elta Systems.
The purchase is part of a modernisation programme for the Paraguayan Air Force that envisages the acquisition of a new generation of radars.
The second phase of the upgrade is scheduled to begin in 2014. It will include the acquisition of a new light combat aircraft. Platforms under consideration by Paraguay include China's K-8 Karakorum, Russia's Yak-130, the Czech L-159 ALCA, Argentina's AT-63 Pampa-2 and Brazil's EMB-314 Super Tucano.</text>

	<text>New modification of flamethrower ordered by Ministry of Defence will allow the special forces troops to fight the enemy more effectively in the urban environment
The Defence Ministry has decided to upgrade the Bumblebee infantry flamethrowers by replacing them with a new modification, the Bumblebee-M. The first batch of 200 flamethrowers will be purchased for the Senezh special forces unit by the end of the year.
The Tula Instrument Design Bureau, which developed the new flamethrower, told Izvestia that the main difference between the Bumblebee-M and its predecessor is the new incendiary mixture and the improved design of the thermobaric ammunition.
- The mixture was improved by the addition of special substances that prevent the aerosol cloud from dispersing into the open terrain, while the projectile itself was refined. The appearance remains the same," explained one of the developers.
Modern flamethrowers fire thermobaric ammunition with a special incendiary mixture. When it hits the target, the mixture is atomized, forming a cloud of explosives. The explosion of such a cloud creates a fireball and a zone of low pressure at the place of detonation ("sucks" all the oxygen out of the air); the difference in pressure and high temperature kills people and destroys buildings.
"The Bumblebee remains Russia's only portable flamethrower. The Russian army also possesses Buratino and Solntepek heavy flamethrower systems (TOS).
A representative of the defence industry complex involved in the development of the new flamethrower told Izvestia that in terms of explosive power the Shmel-M is practically equal to a 152-mm high explosive shell, which is used in howitzers.
- The new flamethrowers have 3-4 times the explosive power of the old Bumblebees, so during an urban warfare special forces can destroy not only small buildings but also 2-3-storey brick, panel and even stone buildings.
The new models of thermobaric flame throwers PDM-A Schmel-M have so far been purchased by the Defence Ministry only for the Senezh special purpose centre deployed in Solnechnogorsk near Moscow. As the centre management told Izvestia, the new flamethrowers are designed for combat operations in urban conditions.
- Special Forces carry out complicated tasks, that is why weaponry and equipment should meet these requirements. It always has special equipment. For example, since the special forces operate at night with night vision devices (NVD), the standard ÏÄÌ-A day rifle scope is not suitable. An officer familiar with the situation told Izvestia, "Therefore the special forces sight is made so that by aligning the eyepieces of the flamethrower scope and PNV the fighter can see the reticle and hit the target with confidence.
At the same time Maxim Popenker, editor of the WorldGuns.ru website, told Izvestia that in the West now thermobaric charges are being abandoned in favor of conventional high-explosive charges in urban combat.
- Now, with most of the fighting taking place in urban buildings against terrorist fighters, it is very important not to target civilians. A thermobaric charge is very effective, but it does such damage that civilians in neighbouring houses can be harmed. Therefore, conventional high-explosive charges for grenade launchers, capable of penetrating the wall of a building and destroying the insurgents inside, are now becoming a global trend. Thereby minimizing damage and casualties," the expert explained.</text>

	<text>A few days ago Deputy Prime Minister D. Rogozin visited the training ground of the 106th Guards Airborne Division located in the Tula Region. Many events and statements were made during this visit, but the most interesting ones were those relating to anti-tank missile systems and their associated systems.
The events surrounding the anti-tank systems began with the Deputy Prime Minister being given a briefing on the Metis-M1 system. After the briefing Rogozin checked his knowledge on a computer simulator, followed by a training launch of a missile from a combat training missile system, which differs from the full-fledged combat system only in the presence of a second optical system for the instructor. After a short training session, under the guidance of the instructor G. Yepifanov, the Deputy Prime Minister hit the training target - an old tank with a white dot painted on it. As it turned out a little later, Rogozin managed to hit the exact mark on the armour from a distance of two kilometres.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, firing from the Metis-M1 anti-tank system was surprisingly easy. Rogozin is known to be engaged in shooting, but before that he dealt only with small arms. Mastering the anti-tank system was very easy: after a short briefing and short practice on a computer simulator it was possible to hit the target directly. Rogozin noted that the Metis is easy to operate and quite accessible for a year's service. Therefore, conscripts should not have any problems with the use of such systems.
Unfortunately for the Deputy Prime Minister, he only managed to launch one rocket. In the skies above the range at that time pilots participating in the Victory Day parade were training, and so all firing was halted for the time being. However, such bans are the exception rather than the rule. According to the head of the firing range Capt. Yakushkin, the soldiers fire at the firing range almost every day and do not skimp on ammunition. Soldiers learn to use available arms both in theory and practice. Nevertheless, the chief of the range complained about the insufficient number of new weapon systems.
As a peculiar illustration to words about constant trainings one of the exhibits of the improvised exhibition organized for the visit of the high guest. In addition to the armoured troop combat vehicles, an armoured Tiger vehicle with a combat module mounted on it was present at the site. The cargo area of the armoured vehicle has two lifting structures on which the launchers of Kornet EM anti-tank missiles are mounted. Each launcher is fitted with its own sighting and guidance equipment and can also simultaneously carry four missile transport and launch containers.
Thus, both launchers of this modification of the "Tiger" has eight missiles simultaneously. The same number is also located inside the vehicle and, if necessary, can be placed on the launchers. N. Khokhlov, Deputy Director General of the Tula Instrument Design Bureau that developed the anti-tank missiles, said that the combat vehicle crew can prepare them for firing and attach them to the launchers without leaving the vehicle. For this purpose the launchers are lowered inside the lightly armoured hull.
Of particular interest are the words of Colonel-General V. Chirkin, Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces, concerning the effectiveness of the Tiger vehicle with the Kornet EM anti-tank missiles. According to him, one unit of such vehicles can destroy up to 16 enemy tanks, due to which eight vehicles have the same effectiveness as an antitank artillery division armed with guns like the MT-12 Rapira. Thus, just a dozen anti-tank systems on wheeled chassis is enough to provide the defense of an entire motorized infantry brigade.
Rogozin commented on the capabilities of the Tiger with missiles in a slightly different way: according to the Deputy Prime Minister, one machine is able to fight "a tank company at once". In addition, he noted the high export potential of the proposed modification of the armored vehicle. As for the specific running characteristics of the wheeled armored vehicle, Chirkin is inclined to see them as an advantage. As an example he cited the famous march in Kosovo. In his opinion, this march on new armoured vehicles would take three times less time than on armoured personnel carriers, as it was in the late nineties.
Data from
The existence of the Kornet antitank system based on the Tiger armoured vehicle became known a few years ago. It was first demonstrated at the MAKS-2011 international exhibition. The characteristics of the system were also announced at that time. The Kornet EM missiles are able to hit the targets at ranges from 150 meters to 10 kilometres. The missile is targeted automatically by a laser beam. The presence of two launchers with their own sighting devices and laser guidance system allows the combat vehicle to simultaneously launch and aim two missiles that can be aimed at the same or at different targets.
The Kornet-EM missile system's sighting equipment enables it to locate and engage targets not only by day but also at night. The sight has two channels: TV daylight and thermal night vision. Each of the channels can be operated in two modes: wide field and narrow field, which differ from each other in the size of the observed sector. Once a target has been sighted, the anti-tank system operator can measure the distance to it with a laser rangefinder. Remarkably, the range measured far exceeds that of the missiles: it can measure ranges up to 15 kilometres. Once detected, the target is escorted automatically or manually.
According to data from 2011, the Kornet-EM system could use two types of missiles, with tandem shaped-charge and volumetric detonation warheads. The missiles have a high degree of unification, but differ in certain characteristics. For example, a rocket with an armor-piercing warhead together with the transport and launch container weighs 31 kilograms, i.e. two kilograms less than a thermobaric rocket. In addition, the anti-tank missile is slightly slower, travelling at 300m/sec instead of 320m/sec. It is worth noting that the most important difference between the missiles is the range. The anti-tank ammunition has a range of only eight kilometres, while the range of ten kilometres relates to the thermobaric missile. According to official data, a missile with a tandem shaped charge is capable of penetrating up to 1,100-1,300 millimetres of homogeneous armour behind a dynamic shield. The thermobaric warhead of the other Kornet-EM ammunition, on the other hand, is equivalent to a seven kilogram explosion of TNT.
Opinions
Back in 2011, the Tiger with the Kornet missile was the subject of much discussion. The proposed fighting vehicle had both supporters and opponents. In recent days, due to the newly emerged wheeled anti-tank system, the discussion has flared up with renewed vigour. Both sides are presenting their arguments and defend their point of view in every possible way.
The main advantage of the self-propelled antitank system is a large ammunition. In contrast to infantrymen armed with similar missiles, an armored vehicle can carry 16 missiles of both available types at a time. Thus, as noted by the Commander of the Ground Forces and the Deputy Prime Minister, one fighting vehicle in ideal conditions can destroy up to 16 enemy tanks at a distance far exceeding the capabilities of enemy tank armaments. The range of the most modern tank cannons is several times less than the maximum range of the Kornet EM, and not all existing tanks can give a symmetrical response in the form of a guided missile launched from the barrel of the gun.
The second advantage of the Tiger over the Kornet EM relates to its mobility. The wheeled undercarriage provides good running characteristics on the highway and acceptable off-road performance. This enables the combat vehicles to change position before it is hit by enemy tanks, artillery or aviation. Of course, the wheeled undercarriage cannot, by definition, provide tank-like cross-country capability, but the lightweight undercarriage greatly increases the chances of surviving on the battlefield. In addition, the retractable launchers provide a degree of camouflage for the vehicle, making it difficult for the enemy to identify accurately amongst other vehicles on the same base.
The armament range of the new self-propelled anti-tank system includes two types of missiles. Thus, the Tiger with rocket launchers is not "tied" to a specific type of target. If required it can bombard the infantry or fortifications of the enemy with heavy-detonating missiles. Combined with a relatively large ammunition inventory, the range of ammunition will enable the new combat vehicles to carry out a wide range of missions.
Finally, the combination of characteristics makes the vehicle-based missile system a more promising weapon system than the towed anti-tank artillery. In fact, the Kornet EM loses out to the Rapira only in terms of ammunition cost. In terms of mobility, survivability and range, the missile system outperforms the cannon. Several decades ago an attempt was made to improve the capabilities of the MT-12 cannon. In the course of this work, engineers from the Tula Machine Building Design Bureau created the 9K116 Kastet system with the 9M117 guided missile launched through the barrel of the gun. It was a worthy weapon for its time, but now it has too serious competition in the form of the Kornet-MM system.
The main problem of the Tiger with anti-tank missiles is that the base vehicle is too weakly protected. An unarmoured or lightly armoured vehicle can be damaged or destroyed even by small arms fire. In addition, vehicles with anti-tank weapons with greater capabilities will be the first target for enemy attacks, which will only make their survival on the battlefield worse. Finally, the cross-country mobility of wheeled chassis is much worse than that of tracked vehicles. Thus an insufficiently protected self-propelled anti-tank system runs the risk of becoming stuck on the battlefield and an easy target for any suitable weaponry.
The second problem of the Tiger-based anti-tank system, as well as other similar systems, lies in the correlation of performance and real-world environment. The armour-piercing Kornet-EM missile flies eight kilometres only in ideal range conditions. Not every terrain where tanks and anti-tank systems are likely to fight will allow the missile to be launched at maximum range. Therefore, the chances of an antitank system eliminating enemy tanks and/or helicopters before a retaliatory strike are greatly reduced, depending on the terrain involved. Once maximum visibility range and consequent firing range are reduced, chances of both sides can be equalized. If necessary, an armoured vehicle with missiles can be positioned at a natural elevation to increase its "horizon". But in such a case the vehicle is likely to draw the attention of enemy artillery and aviation, which together with low survivability dooms it to destruction.
In the light of the relatively low survivability of the self-propelled system and the specific conditions of combat use, the problem of cost comes to the fore. In some cases, the accuracy and mobility of the Tiger with missiles will cost too much, especially when compared to antitank artillery. In addition to the cheap dummy ammunition, the current weapons also have guided missiles, which under certain circumstances could prove a worthy substitute for the Kornet-MM ammunition.
The future
It is difficult to say what the future holds for the Kornet EM anti-tank missile system based on the Tiger wheeled chassis. It has both pluses and minuses, which need further analysis. It is likely that in the future the Russian armed forces will receive such systems on a mass scale. The reason for this development could be attributed to Rogozin's well-known love of new promising armaments and the patronage motivated by it. However, another assumption looks more plausible and practical. According to the Design Bureau of Instrument Engineering, the Kornet-EM missile systems can be mounted on any suitable chassis, regardless of the type of the undercarriage. Therefore, in the very near future, new variants of the antitank system based on armoured tracked vehicles may appear. Such vehicles already exist and are in service: the Shturm-S fighting vehicle based on the MT-LB tractor and the Chrysanthemum vehicle mounted on a BMP-3 chassis.
The need to equip the ground forces with self-propelled anti-tank missile systems has long been overdue. However, the condition of the existing stock of such systems and the rate of its renewal leave much to be desired. It is quite possible that the next modification of the well-deserved Kornet system will become the very system that will significantly improve the situation in the troops and give them a worthy argument in the possible fight against enemy tank formations.</text>

	<text>AKS-74U.</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_automatic_rifle1">
	<text>The AKS-74U shortened AK-74U assault rifle was developed in the late 1970s as a modification of the AK-74 assault rifle (AK-74 with folding buttstock). It was designed specifically for use by military personnel, crews of combat vehicles, gun crews, and other personnel for whom the AK-74 is too big. In addition to military personnel, AKS-74U is also widely used by Interior Ministry, as it is compact and handy when traveling by car or operating indoors. For the same reason, and because it is easy to conceal in a bag or under clothing, AKS-74U is popular with various security services of high-ranking government officials, as well as bandits.  However, it is still considered a shortened automatic rifle, rather than submachine gun, due to intermediate cartridge used in production and mechanisms of standard automatic rifle. The list of the AKS-74U's advantages include high mobility in confined spaces and situations (e.g. inside a car), possibility of concealed carry, and relatively high bullet penetration. Disadvantages are short sighting range and relatively high bullet kill range, low stopping power, and tendency for the bullet to overheat quickly.\nThe AKS-74U is designed with maximum unification in parts and units with AK-74 / AKS-74 automatic rifles. It differs from AKS-74 in the following aspects: barrel is shortened by 2X with correspondingly moved back gas tube, gas piston rod is shortened; special muzzle, serving as expansion chamber (for reliable gas engine operation) and flame arrestor are installed; receiver cover is hinged to the receiver front part; flip-up rear sight is mounted on the receiver cover, with settings for 200 and 400 meters. All mechanisms, controls and general layout of the AKS-74U are similar to those of the AKS-74 rifle.</text>

This replaced four AK74, AK74, AK74H and AK74N rifles at the same time. The barrel and gas tube liner are made from high impact fiberglass polyamide AG-4B. The muzzle brake is now equipped with open chambers for easy cleaning. To reduce the chance of mechanical damage to the receiver cover, the latter has been considerably reinforced. A new locking mechanism has been added to the recoil spring guide pin, allowing the rifle to be fired from the underbarrel grenade launcher GP-25 or GP-30, without the need for the additional receiver lid fastening, which is necessary in such cases for AK74 rifles. The new weapon can also be fitted with PK-A and PK-01 collimating riflescopes. The AK 74M was adopted for service in 1991 and mass production started at the Izhevsk machine factory.</text>

<string id="enc_automatic_rifle7">
	<text>The AK-107 and AK-108 are based on the older AK-108 design, developed at the Izhevsk Machine-Tool Plant (IZHMASH). The main designers of the new assault rifles are Y.K.Alexandrov and V.N.Paranin, who based their design on the Izhevsk AL-4 (developed back in late 1960s), and AL-7 (designed more recently). Both weapons had so-called 'balanced' automatic system, similar in design to the one used in AIK-971 automatic rifle made by Kovrov Mechanical Plant. This weapon has improved the performance of the gun, when fired in bursts of any length, over the traditional Kalashnikov submachine guns, which were the basis for development of the AL-4 and AL-7, as well as the AK-107/108.  In fact, the major difference between the AK-107 5.45mm and AK-108 5.56mm NATO submachine guns and the Kalashnikov AK-74M and AK-101, respectively, is the modified design of the automatic weapons, featuring a second gas piston with mass, mounted on its rod, and a synchronization device, located between the bolt carrier and the balancer. The AK-107 and AK-108 are similar in design, but differ only in the ammunition used. The gas piston system is gas-operated, with the gas piston moving in the opposite direction to the gas piston. The bolt carrier and the rocker arm are synchronized by the vertically positioned pinion between them. The gas piston is mounted on the bolt carrier in the front of the bolt carrier, with the bolt body in the front of the bolt carrier, and in the rear of the bolt carrier, on the rear of the bolt carrier.

	<text>AN-94 "Abakan".</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_automatic_rifle10">
	<text>In 1978 the USSR Ministry of Defence announced a competition to produce an automatic weapon superior in firepower to the already existing AK-74. The main requirement was to improve the effectiveness of shooting, including from awkward positions: on the move, from a kneeling position, without a support. As a result of the preliminary study the scheme with displacement of the recoil pulse was adopted for further development.\
In 1981 an Abakan competition was announced in which twelve models took part. On the results of the competition, the AC (Automatic Recoil Pulse Displaced) rifle, designed by Gennady Nikonov, was considered the most promising. By 1986 the Nikonov submachine gun had been upgraded to the ASM (Automatic Shifted Pulse-Mounted, Modernized) design.\nThe ACM was officially tested by the Taman Division in 1991, and showed a significant increase in accuracy, compared to the AK-74, in fixed bursts of fire, even from awkward positions. After the testing, the rifle was adopted as the standard armament. However, the process was delayed. In 1997 the ACM was officially adopted by Russian army under the name "Nikonov 5.45mm Rifle Rear 1994 (AN-94)". The assault rifle was given the name of the competition in which it won - 'Abakan'. Although the initial plans (1980s) called for full rearmament of the army with the new assault rifles, the Kalashnikov submachine guns remained in service. Both the complexity of the rifle and the economic reasons played a role.\nThe rifle is distinguished by high accuracy and close range: firing two rounds in bursts at a distance of 100 m, a good shooter can hit two bullets at a single point in the target [3]. High rate of fire of the first two rounds has a positive effect on both accuracy and shooting efficiency (in comparison with shooting single shots, the killing effect, stopping power and armour penetration are considerably increased and the probability of destroying protected targets increases). The recoil when firing fixed bursts has practically no effect on the accuracy of fire, and it is possible to aim without resting the rifle on the shoulder. However, it should be taken into account that the recoil pulse is offset to compensate the recoil only from the first two shots. When firing long bursts, the recoil compensation effect is almost absent, and the AH-94 appears to be on a par with the AK-74 in accuracy and bullet dispersion.

	<text>The Groza Otz-14 automatic grenade launcher system was developed at the Tula-based SOO Central Design Bureau and was produced in small batches at Tula armory in mid-1990s. The development of the grenade launcher system for close combat was started in 1992 by the designers Valery Telesh (designer of 40mm underbarrel grenade launchers GP-25 and GP-30) and Yury Lebedev, and by 1994 the first prototypes were ready. Since traditional underbarrel grenade launcher mounting on standard automatic rifles (AK-74 or M16A2) lost a significant part of its balance, and hence a grenade launcher could not be mounted on the rifle itself, it was necessary to design it from the very beginning. In addition, modular design is supposed to provide great flexibility in weapon's operation.\nThis grenade launcher system was originally developed for Ministry of Interior Special Forces to fire special 9mm SP-5 and SP-6 rounds. The Groza-1 variant (otherwise known as TKB-0239) was developed for the army special forces under the widespread 7,62x39 cartridge. The Otz-14 Groza rifle is based on the AKS-74U design, with major modifications including adaptation of the bolt to suit other ammunition with larger case diameter, and a striker-fired hammer mechanism. The bullpup layout is similar to that of the OS-14, with pistol grip located forward, in front of the magazine, and buttstock mounted directly to the rear part of the receiver. The basic design of the OS-14 assault rifle is a modular weapon, which can be configured into carbine, assault rifle (with extended buttstock and additional front grip), silenced submachine gun (with silencer), or submachine gun with grenade launcher (with gripstock and forend switch replaced with detachable trigger lever and selector lever, respectively).

Rifle is gas-operated, with long stroke gas piston; metallic buttstock is tubular, folding to the left and is sufficiently reliable for close combat. Pistol grip, forend and double-row magazines are plastic. The integral silencer also serves as a flame arrester. Thanks to this silencer and subsonic ammunition it provides a sound pressure level of 130 dB. Firing mode selector is located at the rear of the trigger guard, safety and reloading handle are on the right side.\n. 
It uses special 9mm subsonic SP-5 and SP-6 cartridges. The SP-5 sniper cartridge (with steel core) pierces class 2 armor plating or 6-mm steel plate at 100 m range and the 2-mm cartridge at the full range of aim, while retaining enough energy to engage the entrenched enemy. The armour-piercing SP-6 cartridge with enlarged hardened steel core is capable of disabling vehicles and even lightly armoured vehicles. It pierces 8mm steel plate at a range of 100m, and 5mm steel plate or Class 3 armour plating at the full range of fire. This performance is comparable to that of standard 5.56mm, 5.45mm cartridges, which have much higher muzzle energy.\nThe rifle is disassembled into main components (receiver with barrel, automatic mode selector, trigger guard and forend, silencer with sights, buttstock) and transported in the special case together with sights and magazines. The gun can be assembled within 30 to 60 seconds depending on the shooter's skill and experience.

	<text>FAMAS F1</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_automatic_rifle22">
<text>The FAMAS rifles are built using bullpup layout, with the magazine housing behind the pistol grip and trigger. The FAMAS uses a quite uncommon bolt action with lever delayed blowback action, but the FAMAS consists of two parts - lightweight bolt body and heavier breechblock. The bolt has a lever with two arms, one of which, when in forward (closed) position, rests against the cross-bolt in the receiver, and the other is connected to the bolt carrier. When gun is fired, powder gases are forced against the bottom of the cartridge case, and this causes the cartridge case to move backwards in the chamber and push the bolt face towards the breech face. The lower arm rests against the fixed pin, and the upper arm transmits the movement to the massive bolt carrier. This is achieved by moving the bolt head slowly at the initial moments after the shot is fired, and the bolt carrier is accelerated by the upper arm. When pressure in the breech block decreases to a reasonable level, the retarding lever is disengaged from the bolt carrier, and then bolt and breechblock move together at the same speed, compressing the return spring. This movement removes and ejects a spent case and feeds a fresh cartridge to the bolt carrier on its return stroke. The firing pin also serves as a retarder for the bolt, as it retracts the firing pin from its rest position and locks it in place before the bolt group is brought to the closed position.\n. 
	Another special feature of the FAMAS bolt is that it has two symmetrical extractor slots, and the extractor can be switched to left or right side, after the bolt has been partially disassembled. In combination with the spring-loaded ejector on the bolt, located below the firing pin, and the two shell windows on both sides of the gun, this enables the FAMAS to be quickly rearranged for extraction of the cartridge cases on either side. The unused extraction window is closed by a removable plastic cover, which also serves as a cheek rest on the buttstock. The charging handle is located at the top of the receiver, above the barrel, in the cocking handle slot. The FAMAS rifle is unusual in that it has only 3 right-handed rifles, spaced at 228 millimeters. This makes it amenable to almost any 5.56mm cartridge, from the old 5.56mm NATO / M855 / SS109 type with light slug to the new 5.56mm NATO / SS109 type with heavier slug.\n. 
	The flamethrower can be used to fire the rifle grenades straight from the barrel. The firing mechanism of the FAMAS rifle is blowback operated, semi-automatic only weapon. Flag safety is located inside the trigger guard, in front of the trigger. Main safety modes are manual safety, single shots and automatic fire. FAMAS is very compact, and most parts of the gun, including the forend, buttstock, trigger guard and carrying handle are made from plastic.\n. 
	The sights consist of front blade and diopter rear sight, mounted on the barrel, on the special pins, concealed inside the carrying handle. FAMAS rifles are equipped with lightweight collapsible bipods, made of aluminum, on the forend and equipped with carrying strap and knife-bayonet. 40mm M203 grenade launcher can also be installed on the forend.\n.

<string id="enc_automatic_rifle23">
	<text>HK416 is an automatic rifle, developed by German company Heckler Koch, based on M4 carbine. Originally the HK416 was an interchangeable lowerreceiver unit, but later it was made into full-fledged M4 or M16 rifle. The name HK416 stands for the continuity with M4 and M16 rifles. The HK416is available in four versions, differing only in barrel length and weight:- HK416 D20RS - with 505mm barrel length; - HK416 D16.5RS - with 419mm barrel length; - HK416 D14.5RS - with 368mm barrel length. - HK416 D10RS - with 264mm barrel length.\
The straight-bore gas system of the M16 has been replaced by the short-stroke gas piston, used in the HK G36, which is more reliable and dirt-resistant. Improvements to the gas piston system also eliminated the overheating problems associated with the M4's sequential firing. The bolt and return mechanism have also undergone improvements. The delaying mechanism and the traditional T-handle have been retained. Triple-position safety, which is a firing mode selector, has been retained for single shots and continuous bursts. The barrel is cold-forged to withstand more than 20,000 rounds. The receiver is made from aluminum alloy, the magazines are made from steel (standard M16 magazines can also be used). Barrel is hinged to the forend. Rifle is fitted with Picatinny rail on the top of the receiver, and fitted with pistol grip on all four sides of the forend, to provide accessory equipment for various applications. The telescoping buttstock is similar in design to that of M4.

	<text>FN FAL 50.63 (FN "Paratrooper") is an assault rifle, suitable for paratroopers. The FAL rifle is gas operated, semi-automatic rifle. It uses short-stroke gas piston, similar to the one found in SAFN-49 and SVT-40 rifles. The gas piston is located above the barrel and has its own return spring. The gas system is fitted with gas regulator, so it could be easily adjusted for various environment conditions, or cut off completely so rifle grenades could be launched from the barrel. Locking is achieved by tipping the rear of the bolt down, at the special lug at the bottom of the receiver. The bolt is mounted in a massive bolt carrier, which receives a short powerful push from gas piston and moves back and forth along its stroke, compressing the return spring. The gas piston has no need to move inertia to the gas piston after the shot, and then it moves inertially by compressing the gas piston. In the fixed buttstock versions the return spring is located in the buttstock and the bolt carrier is connected to it by special long narrow shank. The folding buttstock is fitted with return spring, mounted inside the receiver cover and mounted directly on the specially modified bolt carrier. The trigger assembly, along with pistol grip and receiver buttstock, is hinged to the receiver from below, behind the magazine housing.\n. 
	The cocking handle is located at the left side of the receiver, and could be folded forward to access any part of the weapon. The safety / fire selector switch is located on the left side of the receiver, above the trigger, and interacts with the sear of the trigger unit. Sights are normally provided by gas-operated front sight and diopter-adjustable rear diopter rear sight. Depending on the country of manufacture, the design details and markings on the rear sight can be different. British-made L1A1 rifles were usually issued with 4x4 scope, SUIT (Sighting Unit, Infantry, Trilux), with illuminated reticle. Virtually all FAL rifles are fitted with long flash hider which also serves as a rifle grenade launcher. The FAL uses 20-round magazines, and some countries (Canada, for example) use modified magazines from Bren L4 7.62mm NATO 7.62mm machine guns (30 rounds) with heavier barrel (C2). It should be noted that British L1A1 or Canadian C1 rifles could use magazines from Belgian FAL or Austrian Stg.58 rifles, but the opposite is not true. FAL rifles also feature different buttstock, forend and pistol grip materials, as well as wooden, plastic and metal parts.\n	Rifles can be fitted with bipods of various designs, which, when folded down, can replace the forend (like on Canadian C2 rifle). Almost all rifles also had a belt clip, and most rifles also had a bayonet lug under the barrel.

Developed together with the rifle also was some special ammunition with subsonic velocity, capable of reliable engagement of targets at ranges up to 400 meters. This ammunition was the 9x39mm SP-5 (with standard bullet), and SP-6 (with armor-piercing bullet), based on the 7.62x39 cartridge of 1943 origin. The SP-5 and SP-6 ammunition had muzzle velocities of about 280 m/s, and weight of the bullet was about 16 grams.  This rifle has been in military service since late 1980s. This rifle is widely and successfully used by various law enforcement and special forces units, including those in Chechnya. This rifle is gas operated, rotary bolt action rifle. The gas piston is mounted above the barrel and is rigidly mounted to the bolt carrier. The bolt has 6 locking lugs. The receiver is milled from steel. The cocking handle and safety are made in the Kalashnikov style, but the fire mode selector is located at the rear of the trigger unit, in the form of a cross-bolt button. The firing mechanism is also striker-fired, and differs significantly from the AK-style action. Barrel is free-floated at the front (after the gas chamber) with several rows of holes that lead some of the gases out from the bottom of the rifle into the rear part of the integral silencer. At the front of the gun, in front of the muzzle of the barrel, the silencer has a series of steel diaphragms with bullet hole, that slows down the powder gases inside the silencer.  Sights consist of the side-mounted sights, adjustable for range up to 400 m, and the rear open sight, mounted on the top of the silencer hood. Standard sighting equipment is a 4x scope, re-marked for 9x39 SP-5 cartridge. The buttstock of VSS rifle is of wooden skeleton construction.

	<text>The TsU-03 rifle was introduced as a weapon for urban and rural military operations, where the increased maneuverability of the short-stroke rifle was a definite plus. This rifle was adopted by MIA under the designation SVU (short sniper rifle), but by the request of the same MIA the TS-03A (SVU-A, after adoption), which was capable of selective fire, was developed in Tula, Russia. However, the latest version of the OtsU-03A (SVU-AS) rifle was introduced, which differed from SVU-A only by folding bipod mounted under the barrel on the special bracket. We must say that SVU-A and SVU-AS rifles should be fired with automatic load only in the emergency cases, as light barrel and small magazine capacity could hardly be enough to fire with this rifle in bursts. There are no firm data on accuracy of SVU rifle, but on short- to medium ranges it is believed to be on par with standard Dragunov SVD rifles. The basic action of the SVU-ASVU rifle is inherited from Dragunov SVD sniper rifle. Gas system of SVD rifle retains gas regulator and short stroke gas piston, as well as rotary bolt locking from SVD. The trigger assembly has been changed, as it has a long linkage to the forward disengaged trigger. In SVU-A and SVU-AS rifles, the trigger group has been modified to provide selective fire capability. Selection of the mode of fire is done by pulling the trigger - short pull produces single shots, and long pull produces automatic fire. There is a special safety interlock which locks the trigger when the gun is fired and limits the travel range of the trigger to zero. The rifle is fitted with a special muzzle brake which combines the functions of the flame arrester and muzzle brake. The sights consist of front sight and diopter rear sight, mounted on folding bases. Aperture is adjustable from 100 to 1300 meters. Rifle is fitted with a scope mounting bracket on the left side of the rifle. SVU is normally used in conjunction with 4X fixed power scope, PPO-1. SVU-AS rifle is fitted with folding bipod, located below the barrel. This bracket is attached to the receiver to relieve the weight of the bipod and gun from the weight of the barrel (for point-blank range shooting).</text>

	<text>The KSVK rifle was developed by the Degtyarev Rifle Plant (ZID), located in Kovrov, Russia, on the basis of the earlier SVN-98 rifle. Originally the rifle was called the ASVK. The rifle is intended to engage enemy unarmoured and lightly armoured vehicles and equipment at ranges up to 1000m, and capable of engaging enemy manpower at ranges up to 1500m. The latter, however, is actually problematic due to the lack of dedicated 12.7x108 mm ammunition, as standard sniper rounds are specially designed to give some scattering effect when firing. Manufacturer claims that KCVK rifle has an average accuracy of about 16 cm at a range of 300 meters, but this should improve with the use of special sniper ammunition.

</string>
<string id="enc_long_sniper2">
	<text>In early 1980's British Army started the search for new replacements for the obsolete L42 Enfield sniper rifles. Main compettitors were britishcompanies Parker-Hale with their Model 82 rifle, andAccuracy International, with their PM rifle.  Eventually, PM rifle was accepted by British Army under the designation L96. Most noticeable feature of this rifle is an unusual buttstock, made from aluminum alloy, which is stretched along the length of the stock and supports the barrel and receiver, trigger unit and all other parts of the rifle, including the stock itself, which consists of left and right halves. The L96 rifle also features open sights, in addition to the compulsory telescope sight. In mid-1980s Swedish armed forces began their own quest for the newsniperrifle, which could survive cold and harsh nordic environments. Accuracy International company introduced a modified L96 rifle, known as Arctic Warfare, and in 1988 Swedish armed forces adopted it as PSG.90. British army also adopted new designation Arctic Warfare rifle, known as L96A1. The AW rifles are known as 'Arctic Warfare', and currently are in service with British army and have four more basic models: Police (AWP), Suppressed (AWS), Folding (AWF) and Super Magnum (AW SM). The name Arctic Warfare (AWP = Arctic Warfare) comes from the fact that these rifles have special design features that allow them to be used in arctic conditions (temperatures down to -40 degrees Celsius). AW, AWP and AWS models are produced only for 7.62mm NATO rounds, while SM model is available in .338 Lapua Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum and 7mm Remington Magnum ammunition. The AW model barrel is 660mm long, the AWP model barrel is 609mm long. Barrels of the AW SM model are available in lengths from 609mm to 686mm. The AWS model is equipped for use with silencer and subsonic ammunition. Accuracy of the basic AW model is such, that at a distance of 550 meters a batch of 5 shots fits into a circle less than 50mm in diameter! These rifles are equipped with Smidt 3-12X variable power scope or Leupold Mark 4 10X fixed power scope, as well as with folding detachable bipod.</text>

</string>
<string id="enc_light_pistol1">
	<text>During early nineties PMS attempts were made to improve the quality of firearms, mainly by introducing a new 9x18 PM (57N181SM) high-pulse cartridge. The upgraded Makarov pistol (PMM, index GRAU - 56-A-125M) was designed on the basis of the PM (Makarov Pistol) for a more powerful cartridge. The pistol was modernized by B. M. Pletsky and R. G. Shigapov, and has been in serial production since 1994 at the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant. Externally it features a larger, more conveniently shaped plastic grip. The grip is knurled at the rear of the grip for a better grip. The PMD can be fitted with either 8-round single or 12-round magazine. Smooth transition of the upper part of the magazine housing to the single stack magazine housing has been achieved without modification of the magazine housing or the bolt. Three gas grooves are made on the sides of the cartridge chamber. Gas pressure forces the cartridge case into these grooves, increasing the resistance to cartridge movement to the rear. As the standard cartridge develops less pressure, the grooves do not interfere with the use of standard cartridges. The maximum pressure in the gun barrel has been increased by 15 % with the new cartridge. As a result, the cartridge is closer to the 9x19 Parabellum in terms of power and striking effect. Due to higher muzzle flash pressure the acoustic pressure at the muzzle of the gun also increased by 20%. The magazine cover is slightly forward, which provides some support in the palm of the hand and can speed up reloading. A change in the grip can markedly improve the accuracy of the gun.</text>

The High Power Mk III pistol was manufactured to higher and higher standards. Electronically controlled equipment greatly improved part quality. The frame and slide housing were enlarged to make it more rugged and durable. The sighting window for cartridge cases was redesigned, as well as the gripstocks were redesigned. The sighting equipment was attached to the slide using the 'dovetail' system, which allowed the boltcarrier to be replaced by a manual front sight, if necessary, and the rear sight could be exchanged for a firing target, in addition to the front sight. The HP Mk III pistol was intended for military use from the outset, and soon was joined by the High Power Mk III S variant. Equipped with automatic trigger locking device, which prevents the trigger from being released until it is fully depressed, the High Power Mk III S pistol was intended for police and commercial sales.</text>

	<text>Beretta 92FS (1989) is a re-engineered Beretta 92F pistol with larger trigger guard to prevent the rear part of the bolt from sliding off the trigger guard when the bolt is cocked. The Beretta 92F differs from the 92F in that it has a small disc on the trigger guard head and a groove along the bottom left edge of the bolt.  This disc serves as a additional guide when the bolt is in motion, and prevents the rear part of the bolt from sliding off the guide when the bolt is fractured.\
In the early Model 92F pistols, bolt breakage occurred after 4,000 rounds, not enough for 9x19mm+P+ or 9x19m NATO-reinforced ammunition to be covered by the 5,000 rounds warranty. In 1987, after the US contract was terminated, the strength of the bolt metal was upgraded, and no firing was detected, but the 92FS model was introduced.\n. 
Distinguished from commercial pistols by markings and exterior finish. It is one of the most common and recognisable pistols in the world. Used by armies, police and special forces in many countries and very popular on the civilian market.

The concept envisaged the creation of a fairly versatile weapon, with a variety of options for the trigger guard to meet the requirements of different customers, as well as high performance. The name of the project, USP, means 'Universal Selbstlade Pistol'. Production of the first USP pistol began in 1993, and in 1995, a slightly modified USP 9mm version was adopted by German Armed Forces under the designation P8 (Pistole 8). Later in the same year, a USP pistol version in US caliber .45ACP was introduced. Unlike the 9mm and .40 caliber weapons, the USP pistols in .45 caliber had 5mm longer barrel and bolt. In 1996, a compact USP Compact was issued, with shortened barrel, bolt and grip. In 1997, the 9mm version of the USP Compact was officially designated as USP P10. Civilian USP pistols, such as USP Match, USP Expert, USP Elite and others, as well as special versions with extended barrel and USP Tactical in .45ACP and USP 9SD in 9mm caliber were also developed on the basis of USP series pistols.</text>

<string id="enc_light_pistol9">
	<text>This gun was developed by the Central Design Bureau of Sporting and Hunting Arms under the supervision of I.Y.Stechkin, and was intended to replace old and outdated APS pistol designed by the same designer. Currently the TsKIB SOO was integrated into Tula-based Instrument Design Bureau to produce and promote TsS-33. It was manufactured in small quantities and is still in service with various units of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Compared to Stechkin pistol, the Otz-33 has much simpler design and less rate of fire, and is easier to handle.\
The Otz-33 submachine gun is a simple blowback operated, selective fire weapon. In order to reduce the felt recoil the barrel of the gun is movable. The bolt recoils up against the massive barrel at the end of the recoil cycle, and, due to its inertia, it pre-brakes the bolt before it hits the frame at the rear end of its travel. Not only does it reduce recoil, but it also decreases the rate of fire, making the auto fire rate reduction mechanism, already used in APS pistol, unnecessary. The recoil spring is located below the barrel. The gun is made almost entirely from steel, with plastic grip panels. Safety / fire mode selector is located on the both sides of the bolt, and is designed to provide single shots (centre position) and selective fire (bottom position).\n. 
In the upward locked position the safety locks the firing pin, trigger and bolt. Moving the safety lever to a position above the safety position causes the trigger to be released safely from the cocking position, after which the safety automatically returns to the upper locked position. Feed is from standard 18-round two-round magazines or from long magazines with 27 rounds capacity. Pistol is fitted with detachable folding shoulder stock, made of steel and carried in separate pouch on the belt. Under the barrel on the frame of the gun there are rails to attach the torch or laser designator. Shotgun also fitted with padded carrying holster and pouches for spare magazines.

	<text>Design of the new submachine gun was initiated by German company Heckler und Koch around 1964. First prototypes designated as MK MR-54 (sometimes referred simply as MK-54) appeared then, and in 1966 police and border guards adopted this gun, known as MP-5, in two versions: MR-5 with fixed stock and MR-5A1 with telescopic butt. Subsequently, MP-5 was purchased by European and other police forces.\n. 
Mechanically the MP-5 is nothing more than a scaled down copy of the German-made Heckler-Koch G3 rifle. It inherited from G3 the steel receiver with folding and detachable trigger unit, as well as semi-free blowback action with delayed blowback mechanism (by a pair of rollers). The MP-5 always fires from closed bolt, which improves accuracy and close range, but also increases the chance of the cartridge self igniting in the barrel if the gun is overheated.\n.

It was originally based on the Austrian-made Steyr MPi-69 submachine gun, but after production of several small batches Kashtan was redesigned, and some shortcomings were discovered. It is nowadvertised as an AEK-919K and is actively marketed for military and police use. It fires from open bolt. The fire mode selector (aka safety) is located on the left side of the receiver, above the trigger guard. The receiver is made from steel and the pistol grip, trigger guard and forend are molded from plastic. Chestnut barrel is polygonal rifling and can be fitted with detachable silencer. Standard sights consist of front blade and flip-type rear sight, marked for 50 and 100 meters. In general, Kashtan is described as small, accurate and reliable weapon, made from high quality steel. In my opinion, a major disadvantage of the AEK-919K submachine gun is an absence of a safety / selector switch, as it is almost impossible to release it with right hand, even for a person with long fingers. When it is not possible to use the second hand, this drawback could cost the shooter an extra second of time or even life.Collimator sight, advertised along with the Chestnut, is rather large nowadays and intended for police use, as it is notably easier to aim the weapon at the sighting area, at the cost of increased discomfort for the gun bearer.

It featured progressive and comfortable ergonomic design. The 5,7?28 mm SS190 round was developed specially for P90, with high penetration and low ricochet. The cartridge has muzzle velocity of 715 m/s and is capable of penetrating NATO CRISAT compliant titanium/ Kevlar armor from 200 meters. The magazine is top-mounted on the receiver and features 50 rounds capacity, horizontally, perpendicular to the barrel, rotating 90 degrees before inserting into the chamber. The magazine is made from transparent plastic, so you can check the number of cartridges in it at any time. The magazine is filled in the usual manner. Cartridges are ejected downwards through the hollow fire control handle. FN R90 is equipped with integral magnification 1X collimator sight with T-shaped reticle. The reticle has an automatically adjustable illumination depending on ambient light, and the weapon is fitted with laser designator located at the bottom. It is equipped with silencer, but can be operated only when subsonic ammunition is used. The Belgian design has succeeded in keeping the weight of the gun and ammunition as low as possible, but this time, the weight of the ammunition and the munition must be kept as low as possible. The Belgian designers developed a low projectile velocity ammunition that featured flat trajectory and low recoil, and made it easier to engage and defeat the enemy for inexperienced soldiers. This weapon was developed as a replacement for pistols and submachine guns, chambered for traditional 9mm Luger ammunition.</text>

	<text>This submachine gun was designed with significant improvement in accuracy, keeping the weight and dimensions of the weapon small enough to fire the heavy .45 ACP ammunition with good stopping power at close range. The Super V submachine gun utilizes rather unconventional delayed blowback action, with rotating bolt recoil pulse redirected downwards. The bolt is of relatively light weight, with lugs that protrude into the slanted grooves of the massive rocker arm, which moves up and down inside the gun. When bolt is fired, its rearward movement is converted into a vertical downward movement of the rocker arm, with variable angles of movement of the lugs to slow the bolt down at the early stage of its movement. Firing is from closed bolt, with cocking handle located above the barrel axis. Folding cocking handle is located on the left side of the gun, and does not move when gun is fired. The fire mode selector is located at about mid length of the trigger unit, in front of the trigger unit, and could be set up for single shots or bursts. Separate manual safety is located above the pistol grip. To further improve gun stability and to further reduce recoil, the pistol grip is elevated above the barrel bore axis, so it could be easily recoiled from the hand grip (previously seen on Soviet MTs-3 pistol, also known as Sheptarsky frame). The magazine housing is located in front of the fire control handle. Currently 13-round magazines are used from Glock 21 pistols, but it is planned to develop its own magazines with larger capacity.

The Bison PP-19 submachine gun is fitted with the magazine, which is made from wood, and consists of 64 rounds of 9x18 PM ammunition in the PP-19 Bison 2, and 53 rounds of 9x19 PM rounds in the PP-19 Bison 2-01. This magazine was based in part on the US-made Calico submachine gun. In this design the PP-19 magazine is located on the gun with a large magazine housing that is very comfortable for the shooter. The magazine is located below the barrel and does not increase the overall dimensions of the submachine gun, but acts as a fore-end to hold the gun in place when firing. The receiver has folding buttstock, which can be folded down for easy carrying and transportation. There are two options, left side-folding or top-folding buttstock. Bison submachine gun can be fired using folding buttstock. Bison is well suited for use in combination with silenced firing devices and modern fire control equipment. It has side-folding buttstock for mounting of collimator sights, spotting scopes and night sights.</text>

	<text>PP-2000</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_near_drobash12">
	<text>The submachine gun PP-2000 was first introduced to the public in 2004, although a patent for the submachine gun was registered back in 2001. The main use of PP-2000 is as a personal defense weapon for non-infantry military personnel, as well as close combat weapon for special forces and special law enforcement teams in urban environment. The PP-2000 is extremely compact and lightweight, with few minor details and a simple design that makes it easy to operate at low cost. The 7N21 and 7N31 high explosive ammunition, originally developed for GSh-18 submachine gun, could be used to engage targets wearing individual protective gear (helmets, flak jackets) as well as to hit the targets inside cars. It is also more profitable against targets inside cars. Compared to smaller Western-made replicas, such as Belgian 5.7mm FN P90 or German 4.6mm HK MP-7, PP-2000 provides more effective against targets not protected by body armor due to its 9mm bullets. The submachine gun PP-2000 is already in serial production and is adopted by Russian Interior Ministry troops. The firing mechanism of PP-2000 is blowback operated, locked breech. Gun housing is made from plastic, enclosed into pistol grip and large trigger guard which allows for two-handed operation. Bolt protrudes from the housing above the barrel, and is fitted with cocking handle, which can be tilted to the left or right side of the bolt. Magazine magazine housing is located at the bottom of the pistol grip, with magazine safety button located at the bottom of the trigger guard. Safety / fire mode selector is located on the left side of the gun, above the pistol grip, and could be set for single shots or bursts.  The patented safety feature of the PP-2000 is a magazine slot at the rear of the receiver. When magazine is inserted into this slot it can be used as a rudimentary shoulder stock.</text>

<string id="enc_near_drobash13">
	<text>The PP-19-01 Vityaz submachine gun is a further development of the PP-19 Bison submachine gun. The Vityaz submachine gun was developed by IZHMASH company specifically to meet the specifications of the Vityaz special forces unit, and was named after it. The Vityaz submachine gun PP-19-01 is now in serial production and is already in service with Russian Interior Ministry troops, as the Vityaz submachine gun is based on either the AK-74U submachine gun or the more recent AK-104 assault rifle. There are two versions of the Vityaz rifle - a basic PP-19-01 variant 10 and a modified PP-19-01 variant 20 Vityaz-SN. The second version features improved ergonomics, with safety and bolt handle located on the left side of the receiver, and additional Picatinny rail on the top cover, that allows for installation of various additional iron sights. The Vityaz submachine gun PP-19-01 can use most commercial and military 9x19 ammunition made in Russia, as well as Russian 9mm 7N21 ammunition with armor-piercing bullet. The PP-19-01 can be fitted with a silencer. The Vityaz PP-19-01 submachine gun is blowback operated, selective fired weapon. It fires from closed bolt. Fire mode selector and safety / fire mode selector are borrowed from AKS-74U rifle. The bottom of the receiver is fitted with magazine housing, specially designed for PP-19-01. Two magazines can be clipped together using special steel clip forfaster reloading. Metal side-folding buttstock. Standard iron sights rail is located on the left side of the receiver. Rifle is open sights, adjustable for range of fire.</text>

	<text>M249 machine gun</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_some_other1">
	<text>The Minimi submachine gun was developed by Belgian company FN Herstal during mid-to-late 1970s and early 1980s, and is in serial production since about 1981. It is in service with many countries, including Belgium itself, the US (designated as M249 SAW), Canada (designated as C9), Australia (designated as F-89), and many others. It is well liked for its outstanding mobility and comparable firepower, surpassing that of the handheld submachine guns like RPK-74, L86A1 and others, which are all based on submachine gun but were built from the ground up as machine guns. It employed a NATO-standard M16 rifle with no modifications at all, and capable of firing a NATO-standard magazine similar to the Vz.52 light machine gun developed 30 years earlier (which also could have been issued to the Czech army by the Vz.52). Minimi machine guns are used to increase the firepower of infantry platoon and provide effective range of fire from 600-800 meters, combined with high mobility. Minimi is a light machine gun, gas operated, rotary bolt locking weapon. Minimi can be fed by either metal tape or box magazines (magazine housing is located on the left side of the weapon, under the tape feeder, and magazine housing is angled about 45 degrees down from the horizontal). The magazine housing window is covered by a dust cover when the belt is used and when the magazine is inserted (with the belt removed) the open cover blocks the belt feeding path. When using a belt, some of the gas motor energy is consumed in pulling the belt, so the firing rate is lower with a belt than with a magazine feed. The belt is usually fed from plastic boxes or canvas bags on a metal frame attached to the machine gun from below, with a capacity of 100 or 200 rounds. Barrels are quick-changeable, equipped with flame arrester and folding carrying handle. Three basic barrel lengths are available, standard barrel 465mm, amphibious barrel 349mm and special purpose barrel 406mm. Folding bipod is located under the barrel on the gas tube. Minimi rifles are fitted with different buttstocks and forends, depending on country of manufacture and modifications. Firing is controlled by pistol grip and trigger, and fire mode is automatic only. </text>

	<text>PKM machine guns are extremely reliable and are popular with soldiers, despite somewhat cumbersome two-stage feed system which uses gas operated action with long stroke gas piston located below the barrel. The bolt has quick-release gas piston, fitted with a carrying handle, which can also be used for replacing the hot bolt. The gas piston is fitted with a manual gas regulator. Locking is achieved by rotary bolt. Ammunition is fed from non-disintegrated metal tape with closed link. Tapes are assembled from 50 link pieces by means of cartridge. The standard capacity of the belts is 100 (manual version) or 200 (machine version) cartridges. Belt feeding direction is from right to left, belt feed and exit windows are equipped with dust caps, as well as empty cartridge case window. First cartridge is fed from the belt, and then cartridge is pushed back out of the belt by the carrier latch, following which it is lowered to the extractor line and pushed back into the chamber by the forward movement of the bolt. Firing is from open bolt, automatic only. Standard controls on the infantry version include pistol grip, trigger, manual safety and a frame stock. Armoured version can be fitted with special buttstock, which has twin grip and trigger switch in place of the stock, and tank variant, which uses electric remote trigger. Machine gun is fitted with folding bipod, but can also be fitted with ambidextrous tripod and adapters for anti-aircraft fire. The sights consisted of the open sights, and infantry version also had a side-mounted bracket for mounting of the night sights.</text>

	<text>RPKM</text>
</string>
<string id="enc_some_other3">
	<text>In mid-1950s Soviet Army started the program of development of a new complex of small arms, designed to replace Kalashnikov AK assault rifle, SKS carbine and RPD light machine gun. The weapon was to be supplied with the Kalashnikov AK assault rifle and a maximally unified machine gun (squad support weapon), both chambered for the 7.62x39 M43 cartridge. The Kalashnikov AKM assault rifle and Kalashnikov RPK machine gun, along with other Kalashnikov designs and magazines, were adopted as standard weapons for the SAF in 1961. The RPK remained the main supporting weapon of the squad until 1974, when it was replaced by its analogue 5.45x39 ammunition, the RPK-74.\n. 
The Kalashnikov RPK submachine gun uses the same basic action as the Kalashnikov AKM, gas operated action with rotary bolt locking. The receiver is made from sheet steel and is more solid and durable than the one in the AKM. The barrels are longer than those of AKM, so it has no possibility to be replaced in the event of overheating. The fire mode selector switch is similar to the one on AKM rifles, it selects single shots and bursts, firing from the closed bolt. Ammunition is fed from removable magazines, compatible with AK and AKM rifles. Two additional types of magazines, a 40-round box magazine and a 75-round drum magazine, were developed and adopted for the RPK. Early box magazines were made from steel, and later ones were made from plastic. Drum magazines are of steel construction, and are expensive and slow to load. RPK was fitted with folding bipod, mounted under the barrel, specially designed buttstock, and sighting equipment with sideways adjustable sights. RPKS variant, developed for airborne troops, featured side-folding buttstock. RPKSN and RPKSN rifles are fitted with side-folding buttstock, and also fitted with folding iron sights, adjustable for installation in the receiver.\n. 
Nowadays the RPK-74M cannon, chambered for the 7.62x39 cartridge, is being developed on the basis of the RPK-74M, primarily for export markets. The main advantage of the RPG-7V1 is its high degree of unification with the AKM assault rifle, and better accuracy and range compared to the AKM (due to longer and heavier barrel).

The grenade launcher is based on the reusable recoilless launcher and firing system with above-caliber warhead. The grenade launcher has a broadened bore in its midsection, a breech block, to make full use of the energy of the propellant charge, and a breech block in the breech face to ensure the launch-less capability.  In addition to mechanical sights, the grenade launcher is fitted with optical sights.

</string>
<string id="enc_some_other5">
	<text>The RPG-6 grenade launcher (index GRAU 6G30) was developed by the Tula-based Central Design Bureau for Sporting and Hunting Arms in 1993 in response to a demand by the Russian troops operating against the separatists in Chechnya. Small series production of the RG-6 began in 1994 at the Tula Arms Plant and the grenade launcher was immediately adopted by the troops and some units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Due to hasty development of the grenade launcher some problems were encountered, in particular, unreliable trigger system. The RPG-6 was inspired by South African Milkor MGL grenade launcher, but its design differs considerably from previous Milkor MGL projectiles due to use of non-rotating, ejectable ammunition.\
The RPG-6 grenade launcher is of revolver type, with six rifled, muzzle-loading barrels from GP-25 grenade launchers. Accordingly, the cylinder is loaded from the front, after tipping the front of the grenade launcher with the false barrel sideways and upwards. The grenades are held in the chamber by special spring-loaded retainers. The drum is rotated by a spring that is manually wound during the reloading process. The grenade case is rotated by releasing the ratchet when trigger is released, thus preventing any attempt to cock the grenade after firing. The firing mechanism of the grenade launcher is same as that of the lenghtght grenade, but in this case at least one lenght grenade ruptured the round in RG-6 (the shooter just threw it back in time, and no one was injured). The grenade launcher is equipped with smooth (unthreaded) barrel, which has only front grip and rear sight. The sights are of folding, stepped type. The buttstock is telescopic and fitted with rubber pad.

	<text>The RGD-5 (Russian acronym for Remotely Operated Hand Grenade, index GRAU - 57-G-717) is a Soviet high explosive hand grenade, described as an anti-personnel offensive shrapnel hand grenade. This means that it is designed to engage enemy personnel by shrapnel as it detonates. Target is reached by throwing the grenade by hand. Ranged means that the grenade will explode a certain time (3.2-4.2 seconds) after it is released, regardless of other conditions. Offensive type - means that fragments of the grenade have a low mass and fly at a range shorter than the possible throwing range.\
Externally the grenade has an oval housing made of thin steel. The streamlined case is assembled from upper and lower parts, each consisting of an outer jacket and liner. The opening for the primer is sealed by a plastic plug during storage. The weight of the grenade with primer is 310 g. TNT with a mass of 110 grams. Fragmentation range - 30 meters.\nUniversal grenade fuse, also suitable for RG-42 and F-1 grenades. Mark of the fuse: UZRG, UZRGM (since second half of the 1950s), or UZRGM-2.

	<text>The F-1 grenade (index GRAU - 57-G-721) is a hand-held anti-personnel defensive grenade. Designed for engaging manpower in defensive combat. Due to its large fragmentation radius it can only be thrown from behind cover, from an armoured personnel carrier or from a tank.\
The so called "F-1" or "limonka" derives its name from the French fragmentation grenade F-1 model 1915, weighing 572 grams and the British Lemon system which was shipped to Russia during the First World War. Another variant of the origin of the slang name is its lemon-like shape.\nThe F-1 grenades were originally equipped with a F.V. Koveshnikov fuse. In 1941 E. M. Viceni and Ah. Ah. Bedniakov developed the universal fuse UZRG, after the war it was further developed and serves to this day under the name UZRGM (Universal Fuse of Hand Grenades Modernized).</text>

	<text>This modern American hand grenade, usually referred to as concussion grenade, is designed to hit primarily by the force of the explosion. It can also be hit by shrapnel, but fragments are of secondary importance.\n. 
The primary function of this grenade is to cause destruction (damage to unarmored or lightly armored vehicles, small structures (dugouts, slots, rooms, fuel tanks, equipment containers) and to disable enemy soldiers trapped inside confined spaces (vehicles, shelters, dugouts, rooms).\nSignificant high-explosive effect is achieved due to the heavy weight of the HE (TNT) charge in the grenade: 227 grams for a total weight of 443 grams. Length of the grenade is 13.8 cm, diameter about 5 cm. According to US regulations the radius of lethal impact on a human being is 2 meters. The grenade fragments can fly up to 200 metres. The radius of safe removal for its soldiers is 235 metres.\nM206A1 or M206A2 fuses used. Remote action grenade, i.e. detonation occurs 4-6 seconds after release of the pulling lever. Before throwing the grenade the soldier presses the lever against the body of the grenade, pulls the safety ring and throws the grenade at the target. The grenade can only be thrown from behind cover.\nThe throwing range limit for an average soldier is considered to be 40 metres. The grenade is coloured black. The markings are yellow on the side of the grenade. This grenade became very popular during the Vietnam War in the sixties when they were used by the US soldiers to eliminate the Vietcong who were hiding in the underground passages. Conventional grenades couldn't do that. The grenade may have some effectiveness in street battles, mountainous conditions. Its effectiveness is questionable in the field combat.</text>

	<text>The M33 offensive grenade was designed as a grenade that could be easily thrown. The grenade has a spherical casing with an internal notch. The M33 is loaded with Composition B. When the grenade explodes it produces about 400 fragments. The M33 grenade uses an M204 fuse. On the basis of this grenade a modification of the M33 was developed, the M67 grenade, which differs from the M67 only in the fuse used. The M67 grenade uses the M213 fuse, and differs from the standard one by the introduction of the two safety devices, the conventional lug with a ring and the wire loop, wrapped around the fuse and holding the lever. The safety feature allows the grenade to be carried by hooking the latch on the belt and due to the small size and high fragmentation rate, the M67 has been very popular with Paratroopers, Marines and Special Forces.\
	The next modification is M68 grenade, similar to M59, which is equipped with M217 fuse, but with the use of the wire loop around the fuse and holding the lever for increased safety. The M69 simulation grenade, which is similar in shape and weight to the M67 grenade, is used for training purposes. In South Korea, a copy of the M67 grenade with a modified fuse design is produced under the K400 designation.</text>

The local basement diner on the outskirts of the abandoned village welcomed anyone and everyone into its alcoholic abyss of cheap vodka and cigarette smoke with a dash of marijuana for everyone who got there. It was the second week of the binge, the money was running out, and I knew that one day this unconscious state would finally chew me up and spit me out into the surrounding reality. It was then that Griff sat down at my table, along with a bottle of vodka, two badly rinsed glasses and a puffy binder.
"They" had everything. Everything about me before the Zone, everything about the events of two months ago on Rassokha. Vulture had a firm grip on my balls, and so I had to agree to all his terms. It turned out that "they" had had their eyes on me for a long time. Apparently, they needed "cadres" like me no less than other groups who were engaged in sharing territory and prey. They needed me so much that they managed to find me even here, in this hole. Later I tried to find out all the available information about the organization, but I only managed to get the name - Syndicate. Whether it was a criminal gang, a joint mercenary cartel, or someone's small victorious private army, I could not find out.
The case Griff had proposed seemed at first sight to be a piece of cake, but the inner voice, which I was used to trusting, was singing in all its chorals - 'boy, it's not just a smell of frying, everything here is burnt to ashes'. Nothing more - to get to the southern marshes of the left bank of the Pripyat, to dig out information on a certain grouping of "Clear Sky", to track down their base and to destroy every surviving member of this clan. Well, it will have to sweat and run to Syndicate forget about my existence, pay the promised fee and give me a new identity there on the Big Earth. Griff didn't even argue with my terms, he just nodded his head, said "You'll get the summary in ten days, at this very table" and left.

	<text>"The freedom fighter, aka The Wardrobe, is helping the cause even after his death. His personal PDA and a recent message from another squad leader will help with the introduction to the Freemen. In addition to the legend "for free stalkers" Griff has provided me with the necessary cover in case I work with the Freedom - free riders and fighters for them are not uncommon. Barin's PDA would serve as an additional aid. Assuming, of course, that the freedom fighters do not indiscriminately fire upon contact. Pity, it's impossible to pull off such an implementation in Duty."</text>

	<text>"Got an update for you. We cross-referenced Cheh's data on the situation on the marshes with the current situation of the major West Bank clans and found a number of discrepancies. Freedom leaders are embroiled in a conflict between a large alliance of veteran freelance stalkers and a marauder gang called Borov, on the former's side. The informant reported that, for all that, the group's command decided to send one field unit to investigate the details of the Clear Sky clan and the circumstances of its disappearance. A certain Goryan, one of the field commanders, volunteered. But the newly minted leader of the Freemen, Lukash, wouldn't even consider other candidates. We ran a background check on Goryan. We were able to dig up not much - he joined Freedom as a volunteer, and had been in the Zone for 2-2.5 years before joining, an experienced stalker. Being a Freeman, he practiced the role of scout, and then the commander of the squad scout - scouted with his men all that is south of the Brains Burner, visited even the eastern shore. He probably received some data on the "Clear Sky" from the command, or had a contact with the netizens himself during his "wanderings" - to trace such a thing in the conditions of the Zone is impossible. After the conflict with the Regenators broke out, "Clear Skies" could not hide their presence in the PRAZO, and could have asked for help from other major clans, like Duty or Svoboda. I suggest you find out exactly why Goryan and his squad were sent to the Moor, and what they really want to find.
About the second squad, things are much more interesting. The detachment of the Wardrobe, as well as Goryan, also practiced the function of intelligence, but in contrast to the latter was engaged in exploration of new territories, hunting for rare and exotic mutants, and perfection of the routes of units of military stalkers and scientists. Went far west and northwest. Disappeared without a trace three months ago, the last signal they picked up was northeast of Limansk. No one's heard from them since. And now they have "surfaced" on the Bogs, pursued by Duty's units, without contacting their own and without joining up with Goryan's unit. I recommend to find out the reasons for the appearance of the Locker's detachment on the Bogs and the tasks it was pursuing."

	<text>"Goryan is another Svoboda commander. According to information from Grif he started as a free stalker, but he has been in the zone for several years, which means he has a lot of experience. He's a hard man to beat, so we'll have to tread carefully. Covert on the Wardrobe and his group will have to replay - I'm still the same freelance stalker in the service of freedom, which found the corpses of freedom stashed in the basement on the northern farm.

	<text>"Now I've got the commander of the Freedom Squad on the hook. Yes, I'll have to help him investigate the cause of the deaths of the freedom fighters, or at least fake that help, but it's worth it. Especially since Goryan has transparently hinted at cooperating in the search for traces of Clear Skies if I help him with that. He knows a lot more than he's saying, but that's not so important right now. There's no profit in eliminating the freedom fighters just yet. At the moment my aim is to work the chain on the Indians. The informant of Cheh's spoke of several units. I doubt they're all going after Libertarians exclusively. Besides, if Goryan thinks the Debtors are rivals in the search - that means they might have information regarding the purebreds, too."</text>

	<text>"Finally, a worthwhile lead. I'm sure Goryan was watching his words and didn't give away anything that would give a "direct lead", but there's one "but" - he has no idea what resources an ordinary stalker might have. 
For one thing, the leader of Clear Skies, nicknamed Hawk. It seems that even this "alias" has been heard by very few in the Zone. And had known for too short a time to figure out what was what. A headache for Grif and his lauded analysts.
Second, the mercenary Scar. Hadn't heard anything about this stalker, would have to ask Cheh about him.
Third, Freedom and possibly Duty know something about some sort of "legacy" of Clear Sky. Obviously they're pieces of the whole, otherwise the feathered base would have been gutted a long time ago.
Fourthly, the base - it does exist. However, the question remains - is it really empty, or speculation stalkers about the clan, rushed to the north in full force - nonsense, not worth a penny... One of the conditions of the order - the elimination of the remaining members of the faction of Clear Skies - depends on it.
It is very possible that both Duty and Freedom have different pieces of the puzzle, and with some skill they can be put together, but to force the information out of Goryan and his cronies makes no sense now. With a skilful approach he will lay out everything himself, and his people will help with fire support in case of need. That leaves Duty, and that's where we'll start."

	<text>"The Black Angels are large anomalous formations of mixed type. Initial readings show extremely high gravity and psi activity. Four such formations have been registered.
First contact was registered a month and a half ago, three out of five in a group of free stalkers from Kordon were killed. According to survivors, the anomaly literally shattered the bodies into molecules and they simply disappeared into thin air. This suggests the possibility of not direct destruction, but teleportation in space - anomalies with analogous type of action, although rare, but occur in the Zone.
"Dimensions are large, the anomalous focus is up to 10 meters in diameter and the zone of active impact is up to 50 meters. Possible effects arising from similar psi influence from anomalies like "Scab", or psi zones, or a short-lived psi field during the course of the attack.
No artefacts have been recorded in all of its existence. However, this cannot unequivocally indicate that there is no possibility of Black Angels forming artifacts."
"It has been established that the anomalies in question are prone to displacement. The total number remains unchanged, but the location of each of the Black Angels periodically changes. Based on observations, it can be assumed that the shifts are not related to emission. If such a hypothesis is confirmed, it can be confidently stated that there is another source of influence on the Black Angels, different from the anomalous energy blowouts in the Centre of the Zone. The impact of blowouts on anomalies within the Zone is practically unexplored, only general principles are established by actual observation, so such a hypothesis, along with others, needs to be clarified and investigated.
A more detailed study is not possible due to the lack of the necessary equipment and skills. A fully fledged research team headed by an 'A' level specialist is needed to carry out a full spectrum of measurements and experimental sampling of substances."

Let's try to see this game through to its logical conclusion. It's still unclear who killed those freedom fighters. Duty, mercenaries-- who?

	<text>"This fucking psychotropic drug didn't work properly. Either the dose was too small or the mercenary wasn't the weakest. Couldn't get him to do what I'd hoped. I had to take him down. However, this did not affect the execution of the operation for a larger account. The southern farm is cleared, the final documents have been found. It was time to report to the client. However, even after studying the materials found on the mercenary commanders, it was not possible to establish who exactly they were working for. Syndicate? Unlikely, but not meaningless - betting everything on just one me is stupid. But if it can organize several squads of fighters, equipped to the highest standards, and deliver them to the marshes - why would they need me? Glock is another possibility. Neither Cech nor I could find out anything about this stalker. Yeah, we heard of him, had a couple of dealings, that's all. This stalker's not easy, not easy. This version is supported by the fact that the stalker was ambushed at the meeting with Sedim, where the Glock was involved. There were measures there, too.
Doesn't matter who they're working for, though. Let Griff and his analysts worry about that. The problem is that the mercenaries have been much more productive than the Debtors, and were able to get close to unlocking the mystery of the "Clear Sky. I'm a step behind them, although I have eliminated the main strike force. Judging by the details, there were a lot more people "lodged" in the southern farm than during the assault. So some of the mercenaries had already left by that time. Where, why, and how to find them now is the question.

Clear Skies uses this collector for their initial experiments, but the main research takes place in the Valley of Shadows. The mercenaries managed to figure out its location as well as the Black Angels. Damn that Black Angels. He's messing with our heads, putting the game on a whole other plane. I don't know who they are or why they're here. But they're targeting decisively, that's a fact.
	Another party has interfered in the Pure Sky inheritance. That's funny. However, they left the lab in a hurry. One of their men was dead before I even found them, which means... No, wait. It doesn't mean anything. He could've just run into an anomaly or caught a stray bullet. No way they dragged him wounded to this place on purpose. Think Red, think... The mercenaries went the same way and came out at the base. They were one step ahead of you, just one step. But they weren't interested in the information you found here. Or were they not looking for it? Why weren't the Angels looking for them? Hell, and why didn't they kill that purebred? Too many more of these questions. I'll find out at the base, won't be long now... That's not what I wanted to hear from Kitov when I questioned him... Yes, and before I was well aware that the Syndicate - not a boarding house noble maidens, and that the Zone is some kind of higher power, which has assumed the right to rule the fate of people who will or will not fall into the trap of the Zone. But... 
I'm a killer, a cold-blooded assassin for hire, carrying out orders. A killer, not a butcher. That's why I can't let those capsules fall into the hands of Griff or the O-Consciousness henchmen. The Zone is a personal hell on earth for the likes of me, and that hell must not enter the lives and fortunes of ordinary people who have not tainted themselves with blood and are living a life of virtue.
To hell with the rules. To hell with the Code. I am no longer a mercenary. My inner voice then, in the stinking bar of Old Settlement, sang in all chorales, but not in alarm, but with delight. The delight of future redemption. I didn't hear it then. Didn't understand it. Things are different now.

	<text>"Duty and the O-Consciousness mercenaries are effectively neutralized-perhaps a few scattered units remain, but that's unlikely. I have all the intel they could find now. Let's start deciphering the data. Somewhere, information about the existence and location of the path to the Clear Skies base will surface. The last of the Clear Skies hit squad, and its commander, a stalker named Cold... This is one of the few that Grif mentioned beforehand, and even provided a picture of him. Even before most of the group's last dash north to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Kholod was listed as a local trader and the head of the "food section". However one way or another, the group could not exist in complete isolation, and Kholod served as an intermediary between Stalker traders and the Pure Sky. Naturally, under the guise of an ordinary lone stalker, occasionally selling artifacts, buying food and other everyday items. The syndicate has identified him from the general population through an analysis of the volume of purchases. Local traders do not get along, much less report to each other on who sold how much and how much they earned. In the meantime, Cold and a couple of assistants have purchased the necessary goods without raising suspicion, but from practically every trader. In this way, an impressive enough volume was amassed to supplement Suslov's shipments from outside the Perimeter.
Cold apparently did not participate in the breakthrough to the north and was left in charge, gathered from the remnants of the group a punitive strike force, led it and began his sabotage activities. I doubt that this was a trivial revenge against all and sundry. No, he had a simple and logical goal - to salvage what was left of the faction, to preserve the legacy of Clear Skies, to await the return of comrades and kinfolk from the North. Cold and Co. could have kept quiet, but sooner or later a path to their secret base would be found. That is why they were forced to make forays and attacks on those who could get too close to them.
But there is a limit to everything. For Cold and his teammates, it came today."</text>
