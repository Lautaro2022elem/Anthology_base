The project proved itself quite well, but there are still some points that require further development and experimentation. Most of all, we recommend that you do a field test of the project, because a huge part of our test subjects in the laboratory conditions showed quite striking results, but after conducting field tests, it became clear that the test subjects are only at the initial stage.\n14.03.2016: \n
After conducting the field tests, we discovered a spy who was having a detrimental effect on the project, not without the help of others. As we learned, the spy turned out to be Professor Romanov. It was impossible to find out how long he opposed the project. The professor committed an act of suicide.
