	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_hunter_dialog_0">
		<text>All right, then. Tell me, what do you know about the Clear Skies Group?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_hunter_dialog_1">
		<text>There's not much to tell. We've seen them around here a couple of times. Once, there was even, like, a posse passing through. Could be a rumor, though. What's true, though, is they recently found a mutilated body in their uniforms. He was most likely killed by some local creatures.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_hunter_dialog_2">
		<text>That corpse is clear, but are you sure there was a whole posse seen here?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_hunter_dialog_22">
		<text>A whole posse, you say. I don't think so. The body's clear, but the posse...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_hunter_dialog_3">
		<text>Fuck that, I'm telling you, it's probably just a rumor. Maybe it's not. I don't know, stalker.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_hunter_dialog_4">
		<text>All right, thanks, and that's it.</text>
    </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_medic_dialog_0">
		<text>Listen, I've been meaning to ask you about the purebots. Have you heard anything interesting about them yourself?</text>
    </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_medic_dialog_1">
		<text>I heard something. Rumor has it one of the agents was killed here. I don't know who, I don't know how, but it was a rumor. The birds, of course, did not go to the trouble, because you know, an agent is an agent. Our guys could have told them to go away and nothing would have happened. However, it seems to me that it wasn't our guys who killed the agent. It was either mercenaries, or bandits, or someone else.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_medic_dialog_2">
		<text>That's how it works. This information allows us to reconcile some of the other facts. You didn't happen to find that agent's body near the farm, did you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_medic_dialog_22">
		<text>Well, that changes things. The puzzle's starting to take shape. By the way, wasn't that agent's body found near the farm?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_medic_dialog_3">
		<text>Yeah, I think it was in that area. And the weird thing is, our scouts found it first and left it behind. Well, we thought, to hell with it at first - dead and dead. There are too many stalkers dying in the Zone. But then they decided to give him a proper burial on the way back. But they couldn't find the body. He just vanished into thin air. We thought the mutants stole it, but no body, no scraps of equipment. They didn't find anything. Now you wonder who took him. </text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_medic_dialog_4">
		<text>I don't know who took it yet, but I have an idea where the body resurfaced... Thanks for the information.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_artefacter_dialog_0">
		<text>Now let's talk about some information. Tell me, what do you know about the Clear Skies stalkers? They're said to have been seen here not too long ago.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_artefacter_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, there's a lot of local chatter. The other day they said they found a clearing in the woods, and there were bodies of Svobodov and Dagovtsy there. And it doesn't look like they killed each other. Either all of them at once and together, or one killed the other first, and then someone finished off those who survived. I don't think I can tell you anything about the purebreds, though. Also we saw a group of strange stalkers here, they looked like scientists, but who the hell knows. Nowadays any reindeer with money can buy scientific suits.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_artefacter_dialog_2">
		<text>Whoa. The hell with the feathered ones and all. As for the scientists, let's be more specific. Where were they seen, when were they seen and how many were there?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_artefacter_dialog_22">
		<text>Wait a minute, wait a minute. Forget about "Clear Skies" for now. As for the scientists, I need more details. When they were seen, where exactly, and how many were there?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_artefacter_dialog_3">
		<text>Huh. You're definitely not as simple as you seemed at first. All right, then. Since I promised you information, you're welcome. Saw them about a week ago in the woods. A group of what you call scientists snuck in from the east. There were about eight of them, maybe nine. No one knows for sure. The next day the scouts tried to track and trace them, only they didn't find anything. And that's very strange. Some say maybe they're phantoms, others say they weren't even there. But personally I'm leaning towards the fact that they just scattered. Each went his own way, and this way it is more difficult to get a trace than in a whole group. Our scouts, although experienced, are far from being super-profiles. They could have easily missed the trail. That's all I know, stalker, about those scientists. Whether you believe me or not is up to you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_artefacter_dialog_4">
		<text>All right. [Sighs] Thanks for your help.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_artefacter_dialog_44">
		<text>Thank you. [Chuckles] Your information was very helpful.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_snab_dialog_0">
		<text>About Clear Skies. I'd be interested in how many of these stalkers were seen and when? Was it a posse or just loners?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_snab_dialog_1">
		<text>What can I tell you. A couple of people came in here the other day. Hung out at the bar, then left. They bought some food and some ammo. Looked like simple artifact collectors, nothing more. Standard stalker gear, weapons too. They did not look like a fighting group or anything like that.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_snab_dialog_2">
		<text>Did they take food and ammunition only for themselves, or for a large group?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_snab_dialog_22">
		<text>They did not buy anything else? Did they only take the ammunition and the food for themselves?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_snab_dialog_3">
		<text>Well, I don't think I can tell you that much about it. Well, ask Vazgen about it... From the looks of it, they only bought it for themselves. And our scouts saw then, how those two left the borders of the territory under our control and went in the direction of Yantar.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_snab_dialog_4">
		<text>I see... Anyway, thanks for your help.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_snab_dialog_44">
		<text>I see... Thanks for the help, at least.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_radist_dialog_0">
		<text>Listen, have there been any rumours of purebreds around here, or have any stalker scientists wandered in recently?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_radist_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah, I don't think I've heard anything like that. Svobodovtsy's been here recently, which is odd. Cause it's a bit far from their territory. Duty comes in pretty often. I don't remember seeing any birds, though.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_radist_dialog_2">
		<text>What about scientists? There's an amber nearby, maybe someone's been here.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_radist_dialog_22">
		<text>Is that clear? And the scientists? There must have been someone, right?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_radist_dialog_3">
		<text>No, I'm telling you. If someone came, I'd remember. There wasn't much information on the communication channels either. If someone was missing or needed help, I'd know. No one radioed in. Ask around more locals, see if anybody's heard anything. I don't believe in gossip, I believe in what I hear on the radio.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_radist_dialog_4">
		<text>All right. Thank you.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_mechanic_dialog_0">
		<text>Give me a hint on a case, if you don't mind. Have there been any stalker scientists around your base, or maybe somebody saw them?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_mechanic_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah, I think so. A long time ago, about three months ago. They come from Yantaray sometimes. No one's been around in the last couple of weeks, though.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_mechanic_dialog_2">
		<text>Well, three months is a long time ago. If there hasn't been anybody in the last two weeks, then...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_mechanic_dialog_22">
		<text>Three months is a long time. Maybe there's been someone later...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_mechanic_dialog_3">
		<text>No, wait a minute. I just remembered something. A stalker brought back a science suit the other day. It was all tattered and bloody. Obviously, he got it off a dead guy. Said, man, fix it if you can. I said, "It's too damaged to be repaired. He walked away with nothing. I bought that suit for parts for a grand. Looks like his owner got caught in some kind of anomaly. That's all I can remember.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_mechanic_dialog_4">
		<text>Right. Thanks, you've been a big help.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_trader_dialog_0">
		<text>Vazgen, listen, a little brotherly help. Have you heard anything about the Chesnonebians or scientific stalkers? Have you seen them around here in the last week or so?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_trader_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah, why wouldn't I? We have, more than once. I just don't see how all this gossip can help you. I understand you're here for a cause. You don't have to lie to me. I know people like you. You all come here for something. And that something isn't just artifacts and money.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_trader_dialog_2">
		<text>Well, that's not for you to decide, my friend, whether that information helps or not. Just tell me what you know.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_trader_dialog_22">
		<text>You tell me what you know. It's up to me to decide if that information helps me or not.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_trader_dialog_3">
		<text>We've seen the others here too. Sorry, I can't tell you any more than that. So if you want to look, look for something more specific. I'm sure the right leads will come up.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_trader_dialog_4">
		<text>All right, thank you, and that's that.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_lider_dialog_0">
		<text>All right, let's get specific. What can you tell me about my case?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_lider_dialog_1">
		<text>I'm sure you've made a mess of things. Your contract is your business, too. Except it looks a little too suspicious to me. It's not clean, Varg. Very. But if I said I'd help, I'll help. You've already gathered all sorts of facts, both about purebreds and scientists. You'll have to hand them all over to the liaison.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_lider_dialog_2">
		<text>When should I expect my contact?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_lider_dialog_22">
		<text>And when should I expect the agent?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_lider_dialog_3">
		<text>Soon, my friend. Soon. What do we got? Clear Skies unit was here about a week ago. A couple of them were seen by our people. One body was found, but it's most likely their agent. The squad itself probably died completely - they were attacked by mutants. The scientists were seen around the same time. One of the corpses was found near an anomaly. The fate of the others is unknown. There is most likely some hidden shelter in the woods that they used. That's about all there is to this subject. These are the most generalised facts gathered from both stalkers and clan scouts.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_lider_dialog_4">
		<text>Thank you for your help. I won't forget it.</text>
  </string>

		<text>Now, let's be specific. What do you have to say about my case?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_zamlider_dialog_1">
		<text>Your contract is your concern. Except if you helped me, I'll help you. You've already gathered all sorts of facts about both purebreds and scientists. You'll have to give them all to your contact. He'll be here soon.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_zamlider_dialog_2">
		<text>Oh, I see. So you do have direct access to Clear Skies?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_zamlider_dialog_22">
		<text>So you have a direct line to the birds?</text>
  </string>

		<text>A Clear Skies liaison? So you had a direct line to the birds to begin with?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a1_main_suget_second_quest_zamlider_dialog_3">
		<text>Yes, I do. So what do we got? Clear Skies unit was here about a week ago. Couple of people from it were seen by our people. One body was found, but it's most likely their agent. The squad itself probably died completely - they were attacked by mutants. The scientists were seen around the same time. One of the corpses was found near an anomaly.

		<text>Hello, there. I'm looking for a job. Need any help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_1">
		<text>Actually, there's a small matter. It's all about your willingness to work. Although, I usually have more trusted people working for me - I rarely take in any stray birds from the outside.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_2">
		<text>Um, do I look like a bird of passage? Or is the artifact specialist such a serious business that he only takes in proven individuals? So what business do you have? More specifics.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_3">
		<text>All you stalker types are whores. The broads at the Sty bar sell their bodies, you sell your artifact-hunting services. So tell me, what's the difference? Well, enough talk. Everybody wants to eat and everybody wants to make a profit... I want the results of the measurements.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_4">
		<text>My name is Varg and I'm not a whore. Remember that, or I'll shoot you in the arm. Measurements, you say? Will I have to install any anomaly scanners or artifact scanners?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_41">
		<text>No, you won't have to install them. They've been installed long before you. But some people have paid for it with their lives. You, on the other hand, will have to collect them and bring them here so I can get measurements from them. It'll help better coordinate our search teams. And they, in turn, will work on safer and more profitable routes. The area's not exactly quiet these days. There are fewer and fewer artifacts in the usual places. So we have to look around for a bigger piece. You don't walk, you don't walk...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_401">
		<text>What kind of scanners? Can you be more specific? They measure anomalous activity - so are they located near major anomalies?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_4011">
		<text>Ordinary anomaly scanners. Their readings will be needed by our technicians to make equipment adjustments. And me, in turn, to prepare the procurement and distribute everything we need to the teams.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_4012">
		<text>I see. We'll have to get a more sophisticated suit. Pass me the coordinates.</text>

		<text>What do you care who put them there? Hassan's men did it a couple of days ago - is that an answer? You're not thinking straight. Your job is to get to those locations as quickly as possible and get back alive with the scanners. Are we clear?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_4022">

	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_5312">
		<text>You're right not to ask. All right, I'm off to get my measurements. By the way, I have one more favor to ask, not even a favor, but information...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_5313">
		<text>Information, you say. I see, I see... I knew from the beginning you were no ordinary bird. All right, we'll talk when you get back. So be careful out there... It'd be a shame to waste your time if you die.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_532">
		<text>All right, I'm on my way. By the way, there's one more request, not even a request, but information...</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_5321">
		<text>Information, you say. I see, I see... I knew from the beginning that you're not just a profiteer. Information - and why not, but only after you've done your job. So be careful out there... It would be a shame to waste your time if you were to die.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_6">
		<text>All right, I'll do what needs to be done. Tell me where to start.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_61">
		<text>Now, that's business talk for a businessman. So here's the plan. First, you find the anomaly scanners. Hassan's men put them there. I've already sent you the coordinates. Then I might be able to find you another job, but I can't promise that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_611">
		<text>All right. Wait, I'll get your scanners. You don't have to look too hard for another job. I'm much more interested in some information. And you might know it...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_6111">
		<text>Information you say... Why wouldn't I be? I figured you didn't just wander into our territory. So we'll talk when you get back. So be careful out there. Don't get lost in the anomalies...</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_end_0">
		<text>That's all your scanners. Although, to be honest, I wasn't expecting you to be the one to do the job. That's usually reserved for technicians or something like that...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_b6_scientist_tech_quest_anomalies_scaner_end_1">
		<text>That's an odd question-- I oversee the artifact assembly teams. Naturally, I'll do everything I can to make them work better. Besides, smart people only do the right things, my friend. And I am a smart man. It's not the first time I've had to do what our technicians do and even more... And the information you're interested in is probably confidential. I think you get the hint... And on the subject, good work, stalker. I'll get back to work on the measurements. You'll get a new job later, or you won't get one at all... In the meantime, ask me anything you're interested in.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_0">
		<text>I'm ready to keep working. What do you need to do now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_1">
		<text>Here's what we do now. We need to set up reserve caches for the needs of our clan fighters. It's a really important job - the clan needs new hiding places. And it's time to set up bait for our enemies.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_2">
		<text>By the way, I forgot to ask. Were you able to find the previous thieves? I'm interested in the specific perpetrators. I also have some thoughts, and it would be good to know who we might run into.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_22">
		<text>By the way, were you able to find the previous attackers? I'd like to know who the perpetrator was. It is desirable to know who might have to face - if they are just local punk kids, that's one thing, but if they are pros, it makes a difference.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Of course it does. It was one of the local gangsters. He set up this little sting by looting one of the gang's important caches. There were quite a few weapons in there. We escorted the scum to a nearby anomaly, and before we killed him, all we could figure out was that he'd looted the place on a tip from someone else. And I hope that now we find out whose.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_4">
		<text>Bandits are good on the one hand. They're terrible fighters. But here's the confusing part. The location of these caches will only be known to a small circle of people for a while. Right? But the whole group would probably find out about them, and how would that work?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_5">
		<text>Not exactly. You're close to the truth, though. You're right in saying that the new caches will eventually be known about by the whole group anyway. However, at this point in time it's the small circle of people you've informed about them that have a clue. There can be no other leaks. And my gut tells me that the rat will reveal himself. Oh, and rest assured, your silence and quality work will be generously rewarded.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_6">
		<text>If it's delicate, I'll ask for proper payment. Also delicate. Some information, for example.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_656">
		<text>Delicate work requires delicate payment. I hope you know what I'm getting at.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_66">
		<text>All right, I get it. Whatever I can do, I'll do. But you'll need a delicate payment as well...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_7">
		<text>I think we can agree on that. You're gonna stake out all the stashes for now, then come back here. I've texted you the coordinates.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_first_dialog_8">
		<text>All right. [Sighs]</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_second_dialog_0">
		<text>So I've planted all the stashes in the places you've indicated. What's next? And I think your plan paid off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Now... The next step is this. You need to fill them with the necessary first-aid supplies. Some food, medical supplies, a couple of packs of ammo. I've already uploaded a full list for you as well. Some of the more expensive items you'll be getting right away. All right, hold on. You said my plan paid off? Give me the details.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_second_dialog_2">
		<text>A group of thugs tried to rob me near the south roadblock. They were right near the spot I told the collector about. That's the spot I told what's-his-name Mahir about.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_second_dialog_22">
		<text>A group of bandits tried to attack me. It was near the place I told Mahir about.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_second_dialog_3">
		<text>There you go. So Mahir. Well done, my friend. At least now it's a lead. He knew you'd be in the area and had a way to get the goons on you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_second_dialog_4">
		<text>Okay. So now we know exactly who sent them. That's what you needed in the end - this whole stashing thing was rigged to figure out who was going to attack me. Since you used me as bait, let's now decide on payment and guarantees. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_second_dialog_44">
		<text>Now you have an idea of who might have sent them into the area. And since you essentially used me as bait in this clever trap, let's now decide on payment and guarantees. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_second_dialog_5">
		<text>Don't get too excited. You'll get your guarantees. You're alive, so it's all good. You're a smart kid, I see. You figured out the triple-cross thing right off the bat. That's good. Less questions for you to ask later. All right, then. Go finish what I hired you to do, and then we'll talk about your question.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_second_dialog_6">
		<text>That's right. I'll only ask questions about my subject. And I hope your answers don't leave me dissatisfied...</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_third_dialog_0">
		<text>Well, it's done. The stash is laid out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_third_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, that's good. Two birds with one stone. The stalkers help the stalkers, and I get my own benefit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_third_dialog_2">
		<text>That's true. But I'm much more interested in my third hare. You didn't risk my life for nothing... So I'll need information on the appearance of a group of scholar stalkers here, as well as any purebreds who've come here in the last couple of weeks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_third_dialog_22">
		<text>Bunnies are fine, but back to my sheep. I need information on the arrival of a group of scientists and any purebreds that have come here in the last couple of weeks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_quest_third_dialog_3">
		<text>You didn't take a chance for nothing. So this is what it turns out to be. You're specifically interested in Clear Skies. All right, then. Let's talk. Ask more specific questions. Oh, and get this. Now I'm going to need to resolve the Mahir issue. Since you've been on this case from the start, you'll have to finish it. Come back when you're ready.</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_snab_quest_third_dialog_4">
		<text>All right.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_radist_pred_dialog_0">
		<text>Hey, bro. Listen, help me out here. I got a radio set here. It's like a direction finder. Why don't you buy it? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_pred_dialog_1">
		<text>A direction finder, you say. How much are you asking?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_pred_dialog_2">
		<text>Three grand. Plus, you don't ask how I got it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_pred_dialog_22">
		<text>I'll give it to you for three grand. Besides, you don't ask unnecessary questions about its history.</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_radist_pred_dialog_3">
		<text>That'll do. There you go. I wouldn't ask any questions. Our clan's stalkers don't have that kind of equipment, and I'm not interested in the rest. Even if you did kill the previous owner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_pred_dialog_4">
		<text>Thank you for not saying no.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_0">
		<text>By the way, do you have any work in mind?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_1">
		<text>A job... That's a tricky question. Depends on what you can or can't do. It also depends on what exactly you want the job for.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_22">
		<text>I see. I'll come back later before I can work for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_2">
		<text>Well, I need a job to make money. Whether or not I'm good at something depends on what you have to offer. So I'm a pretty generalist, and I've been stomping around the Zone for a while now. For a while I worked under Orest from Agroyantar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Broad profile you say. Well, let's see what you're good for. Just because you're from Orestes' clan doesn't mean anything to me. It's more important to me how well you can hold a soldering iron than how well you can search for artifacts or shoot mutants. I'm gonna have a specific case for you. If you can handle it, good.</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_4">
		<text>I'm listening. What exactly do you need from me?</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_44">
		<text>Get to the point. What do you need me to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_444">
		<text>Can we just cut to the chase?</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_5">
		<text>In a nutshell, here's the deal. As you have already understood, I am responsible for radio communications here and also for everything related to the various radio communication devices. I have to work closely with the technician and the supply man - but that's another story. And our story is this. Our clan here, and in some other locations, have hidden radios installed. Don't ask what it's for. Yeah, I think you already know why. Here... And it looks like one of them just blew up. There's no telling what might have happened to it. It's your job to find out. Grab some tools from me, and you're on your way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_first_dialog_6">
		<text>All right. (sighs) I'm on it.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_second_dialog_0">
		<text>All right. I checked the radio station. It's pretty shitty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, what happened to it? Surely a couple of circuit boards must have malfunctioned during the mission? Been there and done that before.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_second_dialog_2">
		<text>Not really. Here, take your multimeter back. You're right about one thing - one of the boards must have blown. However, it looks like somebody screwed it up on purpose. It doesn't look like a simple fly-by-night bandit would have ripped it out. The Free or other clans don't seem to want it either. It looks like a pro was working there and he knew what to break and how to break it. And, more importantly, where exactly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_second_dialog_3">
		<text>On purpose you say. Now that's interesting. Who would want to take out a radio station? I don't really care, though. I'll let Hasan know. Then they'll sort it out themselves and look for the saboteur. Our task is to get it working again as soon as possible. So get a soldering station, solder what you need and move to the point I gave you. Put it in a more inconspicuous place. You put the radio itself in a special box, but keep it clean so it doesn't loom in plain sight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_second_dialog_4">
		<text>All right. What about setting it up? Wouldn't it have a slightly different coverage area?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_second_dialog_44">
		<text>What about setting it up? Wouldn't the coverage be different, would it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_second_dialog_5">
		<text>I see you know a thing or two. You're asking the right questions. Don't worry about the setting. I'll take care of it later. That area's already covered from the backup channels.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_second_dialog_6">
		<text>All right. Copy that.</text>
	</string>	
	
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_third_dialog_0">
		<text>It's done. Radio's repaired and set up in its new location. So you can go ahead and tune it up and roll up the backup channel.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_third_dialog_1">
		<text>Well done, my friend. Just return the equipment you borrowed from me. You'll get paid handsomely. You're a proven stalker. Not everyone would take on a job like this. Well done. You'll go far if you don't ask too many questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_third_dialog_2">
		<text>Our whole lives are made up of questions that we try unsuccessfully to find answers to. Here's your blowtorch. What, by the way, is your boss? How did they react to the news of the sabotage? Any idea who might have done it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_third_dialog_22">
		<text>Here's your blowtorch. By the way, how did your superiors react to the news of the sabotage? Any idea who might have done it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_third_dialog_3">
		<text>Yeah, who knows. They're stepping up their vigilance. But the way I see it, all that vigilance will go down the drain with Harold and Hasan running the place. But that's strictly between us girls. They're both pretty good stalkers, I guess. But there's been a lot of suspicious things going on around here lately. And yet, neither one of them even lifted a finger. They seek only own profit - how to cheat each other and to ship lots of artifacts to left suppliers. Without anyone knowing anything about it. I wouldn't be surprised if one of them even ordered the equipment to be broken in order to pin the blame on the other.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_third_dialog_4">
		<text>Wow. (chuckles) There you go. Interesting conclusions. At first you didn't strike me as the kind of man who'd be that interested in clan affairs. Aren't you afraid to say that to me? And it's strange, the clan leader confronting his deputy. What's one trying to take the other's place? What's the point? I mean, they're both running the place as it is... No. It's something else. Something I can't figure out yet. You said something suspicious, by the way. Do you have any concrete facts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_third_dialog_5">
		<text>Yes, in principle, nothing in particular has happened. Well, unusual, so to speak. It's quite usual for the zone. There have been a couple of episodes where groups of artifact dumpers have gone missing. Then they've been found with their guts hanging out. Recently, the Znakhar was killed. He was our first medic. By the way, he was one of the veterans who founded the group. Why I think he was murdered is simple. The remains of his body were found in the cold cuts. Most people think he went in there drunk. Except he wasn't drinking that night, that much I know. And when you think about it, it's a pretty convoluted picture...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_multimetr_quest_third_dialog_6">
		<text>Well, well... Gee. I'm not really interested in that. I've got my own business here. But I don't think I'm gonna get past what's going on here that easily. Well, let's talk about a case later. It might even have something to do with the events you described.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_init">
		<text>Listen, do you have an errand for me to run? Cause I'm new here, and I'm looking for a job. You're a doctor, after all. I'm sure you need help with something.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_about">
		<text>Basically, I can't offer anything in my line of work at the moment. But you could help with something personal, so to speak. Two, even. I've got a debt from last time, I need to return two artifacts to our dealer. The locals call him Vazgen. Churkestan, man... If you've ever dealt with him, the fucked up profiteer, you'll know what I'm talking about. I have no love for him and he has no love for me either. We don't have the same characters... Phew, we're not on the same page. I'd have done it a long time ago, but my bosses and his business associates, what's the fucking word, "partners", would have skinned me for this kind of rudeness. But he can't get me out of the clan either... Churkestan tried, the scum-sucker, but it didn't work. The previous medic had recently taken a bath in cold water, and they have no more doctors. That's just lyrics, but artefacts are reality. And it is a rare reality, like a goddamn fair win at the Sports Lotto, - such artifacts are not lying around every corner... And I'm like a toad with a ballerina. Maybe even worse. Anyway, you find me those artifacts, you do me a decent favor. And, yeah, man. I think you could use a fancy detector - I can get you one. Free of charge. However, I can offer you another way to solve this problem. You'd have to do the same thing, but with more risk. But I'll pay you more. So, you in? And then maybe we'll get some more medical business. Every day we have a green cormorant flying into an anomaly or a wild boar getting its fangs in. If it's to the death, it's not. They stay fucking alive. What do you want me to do with these cripples?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_about1">
		<text>I'll do what I can to help.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_nah">
		<text>Not unless I work for you...</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_var_2_arts_1">
		<text>What's the second option?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_var_2_arts_2">
		<text>I knew that's what you'd be interested in. It won't change the nature of your job-- you'll still be looking for artifacts. But in a different place. How I dispose of them is not your further concern.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_var_2_arts_3">
		<text>Good. That's good enough for me. Come on, tell me exactly what you want to find.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_var_2_arts_4">
		<text>"Meatchunk and Firefly artefacts. Don't give me that look. Artifacts are rare, I know. But I don't have much of a choice. You choose the worst of two evils. A friend of mine, now deceased, whispered to me... He said there's a dead man not far from the village recently. The dead man had those artifacts. The kid took care of the innocent's body, but the artifacts had to be stashed almost in the anomaly itself. Simple detector that our collectors use won't pick them up. So they might still be there for a while. If they're still there, get them and bring them to me. So, you go on ahead to the thermal anomaly, while I figure out how to get the Churkman to take them and not the other specimens. Maybe I'll even make a fortune on this one.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_var_2_arts_5">

	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_start2">
		<text>"Heaven's Apple and Bengal Fire. Pick your fucking jaw off the table. I don't suppose you've heard of these, have you? And already I'm ready to sign up for it. Something tells me I was a little too hasty about you, huh?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_ok">
		<text>Oh, wow! Yeah, "rare"... Had I told you that you have to deliver a red Ferrari right now and right here in the Zone - would have been less surprising... Although I remember - one businessman from Kiev once did so. His name was Graygorovicius, don't you remember? Anyway, that's what I decided. I don't have much of a choice, do I? You'll get your artifacts, you wait. I'm embarrassed to ask how you managed to get into bondage with them...</text>
    </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find">
		<text>Look, look... I didn't ask you to do that. I'll wait by the fucking sea for the weather. If you find it, come straight here. It's better to part with it and keep it quiet, otherwise they'll put it on the missing persons list, drink to its repose and forget about it. Don't ask me how you got into debt. It'd be cheaper to shoot you right here. So go on, get a move on. Say hello to Greigovic. He's probably driving a Lamorborgini around the Zone...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_where">
		<text>Hold on, man - why are you so fast, like you have diarrhea? Artifacts are really rare and expensive, you won't find them in the nearest ditch. You may be a lousy prospector, but I don't think you've been sitting on your debt and not worried about your ass. You got any leads?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_hz">
		<text>Yeah, I got a little, but I checked with the knowledgeable... "Heaven's Apple is gravitational in nature and Bengal Fire is electrical, but, man, they're both tricky. In our neck of the woods, the artifacts are a mess. Wherever you want, that's where they can be born. No special system. Well, there is a system, but who's to say it to you, an outsider. Life's not nice without tricks in the Zone, eh? In short, you should look where there is a lot of radiation and gravi-concentrations, and even better - where "torches" are flying. But, hell, they're both natural modifiers, as Jorakh explained to me. They like, you see, in addition to the native anomaly, and others. And if our fat, phew..., sailor isn't completely out of his mind in this world, then "Apple" needs more radiation, and "Shard" needs something from chemistry, like "Cholodz" or "Burning Fluff". You got it all memorized? I won't say it again. Anyway, the best place to look is at the farm, in the radium piles. Go on, take a shot for the road, and then go ahead and get into the whirlpool.</text>

	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find_what">
		<text>Well... Wow, kid, you really are a piece of work, aren't you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find_second_item">
		<text>You bet I am. Here's the Bengal Fire. Took a lot of work to find it...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find_first_item">
		<text>Yeah. So far, just the Apple. That's half the battle, huh?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find_first_or_second_item">
		<text>There's both the Apple and the Bengal Fire. If I didn't need it, I'd give it up. Without your tip, there'd be no way to find it at all. Keep your stuff, you'll figure it out from there.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find_end">
		<text>Well, man! Not for nothing I relied on you, rare stalker not only finds, but also gets, and even up to the place will bring these artifacts. Cool, cool... Like a hard-boiled egg. All right, I'll take care of Vazgen the dickhead later. I'll take care of my debt... In the meantime, let's get back to your question, all right?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find_nothing">
		<text>No results so far. I'll keep looking. I'll let you know if I hear anything.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find_item_instr">
		<text>Hey, Bengal Fire... Big deal, as they say. Except that's half the battle, right? If we get Apple on top, we'll work it out for another job.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find_item_flash">
		<text>Veri gud, as they say. "Apple's the ticket, but without The Shard, Churkestan won't cover my debt. So get moving, it ain't gonna wait till nightfall. You're the one who wants to make a profit, not me, so move it. So long, young one, heh.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_sborki_find_item_all">
		<text>All right, I got both the art. Now we're gonna talk to you in the right direction.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b30_owl_medic_quests_end_0">
		<text>It's done, my friend. Artifacts found. Here, take it.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b30_owl_medic_quests_end_1">
		<text>Thank you. Now I can call you friend. You keep the detector. You're going to need a machine this powerful. Consider it part of the fee. And keep your share in cash. Now, I can talk to you in a slightly different vein. And maybe even offer you a slightly different job.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b30_owl_medic_quests_end_2">
		<text>Thanks for that. I could use a good detector like that. By the way, have you decided what you're going to do about your debt? I understand you owed the merchant some other artifacts. What do you want to do now?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b30_owl_medic_quests_end_3">
		<text>We'll figure it out. Told you it's none of your business anymore. Forget about the artifacts. Any other questions?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b30_owl_medic_quests_end_4">
		<text>All right, forget it. </text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_peredacha_init_dialog_0">
		<text>So, Churkestan's foe, what other work do you have to offer?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="topi_medic_quest_peredacha_init_dialog_1">
		<text>Okay, stalker. Let's put the jokes aside for now. I've just been contacted by Limp's posse. He's one of our head scouts. One of his men is seriously injured. We don't know what's wrong with him, he may have been hit by a psi-strike. Who the hell knows how. Could be a controller. Come on, get to the village as fast as you can.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_peredacha_init_dialog_2">
		<text>What am I supposed to do with him, this Scout?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_peredacha_init_dialog_22">
		<text>What do I do now? What do I do with this Scout now?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="topi_medic_quest_peredacha_init_dialog_3">
		<text>Like what? Treat the fucker. Look, don't piss me off. I'd go myself, but Hassan, the other Churkestan, sends me on some urgent business. A man's dying and he wants to do whatever the fuck he wants. Anyway, you want a job, you get it. Here's a special first-aid kit with everything you need... You can give it to the scout later.</text>
  </string>	
	<string id="topi_medic_quest_peredacha_init_dialog_4">
		<text>Right. I'm on my way.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b1_stalker_group_wounded_dialog_0">
		<text>Steeler, help me, it's in my head - I don't know what it is... I can't take it anymore.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_stalker_group_wounded_dialog_1">
		<text>All right, hold on - don't move. Let's see...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_stalker_group_wounded_dialog_2">
		<text>Thank you... What, what was that? My brain feels like it's being burned alive.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_stalker_group_wounded_dialog_3">
		<text>I don't know what the hell you got yourself into. Looks like a psi hit. Did you see a controller before it happened or something like that? Maybe there was an unknown psi anomaly? What do you remember at all?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_stalker_group_wounded_dialog_4">
		<text>There were no anomalies. I only remember one person. It was a person. Some kind of stalker. He walked past and staggered towards the woods. It wasn't a controller, that's for sure.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_stalker_group_wounded_dialog_5">
		<text>All right, thanks for the info. Take care.</text>
  </string>
		
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_0">
		<text>Oh, great. I'm here on behalf of Elymeus. Your man was wounded...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_1">
		<text>And good riddance to you, hobo. Why didn't the medical bug come here himself - I told him it was an emergency? What, you're such a good healer? And what happened to my man?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_2">
		<text>Your man's dead. His injuries were too severe... I didn't have time to treat him in time. Take the med kit-- it's unused.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_3">
		<text>That's how it works. What the hell do I need a doctor like that for? Maybe I should shoot you after him and be done with it. Elimay's a sneaky motherfuckin' rat - sits his ass down at the base and sends some yellow-haired lockpick in his place before he even makes it there...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_4">
		<text>Take it easy, Scout. I'm actually on my own here. Working for Elymaus is a one-time job. He warned me that your man might not make it - that's why he sent me here. He was detained there by your castle Hasan on some business... What's the point of me getting caught like this?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_5">
		<text>Well, well... Elymius says Hassan detained him. That's how it turns out. So it's not your fault, per se. All right, then. What else did that motherfucker want me to tell you? You say you're on your own and you've been working for the doctor. So you don't mind mercenary. You ain't gonna be with the blue-collar crew, are you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_6">
		<text>Nothing else. I got nothing to do with the blues. They always go their own way, I'm more concerned with feathered creatures. And what exactly happened to your man? I need to know as much as possible.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_66">
		<text>I have nothing to do with mercenaries. I'm interested in the purebreds. And what exactly happened to your man? I need to know as much detail as possible.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_7">
		<text>Feathered ones you say... Purebreds don't have much influence here. We can talk about it in more detail. About the dead stalker, that's a hell of a thing. He was either caught in an anomaly, or some controller, or some psionic had covered him with a wave. That's not what's confusing me...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_8">
		<text>Let's talk more...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_22">
		<text>Your fighter survived. I managed to save him. And he said some pretty strange things. Elimay didn't come - because Hassan detained him. Take the med kit, by the way. Someone else might need it. Elymius told you to give it to him later.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_33">
		<text>Hasan, you say. All right, well... What exactly did the wounded man tell you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_44">
		<text>Said he saw a man. I think it was the controller. The guy's mind was already under psy-attack. He may have seen something, or rather now he remembers the illusion the mutant created in his head.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_55">
		<text>You think so, stalker? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Psionics can be more dangerous than controllers. And they're more dangerous because they're indistinguishable from humans. That's probably what he was. That's all the pain in the ass we need around here... So just pray it really is the controller. Oh, and thank you for saving the kid's life. If you want to work for our clan or just hang out, that's fine with me.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_medic_peredachaquest_complete_dialog_676">
		<text>All right.</text>
  </string>	
	
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_first_dialog_0">
		<text>I'm new here. Don't know much about your clan. As I understand it, you're the commander of local scouts - not an ordinary stalker, so to speak. I'm interested here mostly in work and the Clear Skies faction. Can you help me get started?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_first_dialog_1">
		<text>I can help you. As long as you use it wisely. If you try to harm my clan, you die. If you try to resist, you'll die slowly. But if you cooperate, you will be richly rewarded. Your dealings with the birds are of no interest to me, and I will tell you only what can do no harm to the clan. Then it's up to you whether you want the information or not. As for the job, I can offer you one pretty risky case. How's that working out for you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_first_dialog_2">
		<text>It's fine. Let's talk about your assignment first. What exactly am I supposed to do?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_first_dialog_22">
		<text>You got it. Let's talk about your assignment first. What do I have to do?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_first_dialog_3">
		<text>I like your attitude, stalker. Good. This is serious business. And a serious risk to life. But it's worth the price. We need to scout an area. There's an old farmhouse not far from here. It's not what you'd call a key area, but there's still some good base facilities there. If not a base, then a permanent camp, or at least a staging post. Caravans of artifact hunters not infrequently pass through the territory under our control and, one way or another, they have to ensure their safety. I don't know why, but the castle has a negative attitude towards the idea of occupying this stronghold. However, at the very least, a proper reconnaissance has to be done there. There have been recent sightings of mercenaries in the area. We do not know how or why they got there. But the guys were clearly serious. Go there and see if any of them are still there. And if they left any unpleasant surprises in the form of mines or land mines. Here, take the mine detector... And be careful out there.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_first_dialog_4">
		<text>Okay. (clears throat) Well, I'm clear on mine clearance. I think I can handle it. But if it turns out to be mercenaries, what do I do? I can't fight an entire brigade. Is there any way you can back me up?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_first_dialog_5">
		<text>There isn't an entire brigade. We only saw a few men. One of my men will be in the vicinity, watching your back. Don't try to find him... Unless he wants to be found, no one will find him. As he reported, the farm is quiet now, no sign of mercenaries. Even if there is someone there, the two of you can handle it. You should be more concerned with clearing the site. That's one. Two, looking for any sign of our blue friends. I don't think they wrote "you were here" right on the wall, but there's bound to be some trace.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_first_dialog_6">
		<text>Copy that. On it.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_0">
		<text>The hired friends left us with a few surprises. The mine detector came in handy. Any group of freelance stalkers out there before me would've blown themselves up.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Right. Good work, stalker. Did your cover, by the way, turn up?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_2">
		<text>No. You got your scouts trained pretty good. Can't find them in the woods, can't see them. But they can take you down - you won't even know how or where. They're a professional bunch.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Scouts, they're the eyes and ears of the group. All right, we're getting sidetracked here. You find anything suspicious besides a couple of land mines?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_4">
		<text>Nothing much, I guess. There were signs of a recent campfire, food scraps. Looks like they used this place as a one-time stopover...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_5">
		<text>All right, stalker. I hate to disappoint you, but it looks like your work was for nothing. Hassan, that son of a jackal - he's given the go-ahead to occupy the abandoned farms. Something's not right here, my friend. And you don't seem to be entirely honest with me either... You'd better hold still. I got two of my best men on you right now. You reach for that gun, I'll put a bullet between your eyes. You get the hint?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_6">
		<text>More than...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_66">
		<text>I do. What do you want?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_7">
		<text>You're saying the campsite we found was temporary? Then how do you explain the fact that the mercenaries weren't seen here for the first time, but at regular intervals? And how do you explain the fact that after you searched the farm, another of my men found the body of a mercenary there? I suggest you think carefully before you answer any questions...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_1_quest_second_dialog_8">
		<text>I'll only answer your questions if we survive now. Unholster your guns, there's a wave of creatures...</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_0">
		<text>By the way, do you have any more work for me to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_1">
		<text>All right, let me think. That's not it, that's not it either... I think this one's good for you. You did a great job on the broken radio, so I think you can do this one too. We got a memo from our superiors. It's all about increased vigilance. Radar work, for short.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_2">
		<text>Radar's a thing. I think I'll take the job. Where'd you get them from, anyway?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_3">
		<text>After that incident and some others, the leaders decided to set up a special radar tracking system. I don't know where our perpetual latecomers managed to get their hands on them. The Credo 1E radar-- does that mean anything to you? That's just it. A unique piece of military equipment was recovered and delivered to the Zone. And now we have to deal with it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_22">
		<text>Radars, you say? I don't feel like dealing with them yet. Let me come back later.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_222">
		<text>Nah, I'm not interested in the tracking station stuff just yet.</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_4">
		<text>We'll figure it out, I guess. It's not the first time for me. What do you need to do first?</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_44">
		<text>We'll get everything organized. Where do I start?</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_5">
		<text>First, set up the main radar modules in key locations that cover the main tracking areas. The main module will be disguised as a simple wooden crate, which are all over the area. I seem to have the modules themselves set up. Well, I think I got it all set up right. They're pretty big in there. Battery pack, transceiver unit, primary processing unit and others. They all have their own configurable parameters. Well, not the point. That's my part of the job. You fix the whole thing, and I'll try to connect remotely and check it's working. If we can get a signal, then it's working. If it doesn't, I'll have to look for a problem.</text>
	</string> 	
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_first_dialog_6">
		<text>You got it. I'm on my way.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_second_dialog_0">
		<text>I think I've done what you asked. Dradis set. Modules are laid in. Is everyone on it? Did you check to see if they were functional?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_second_dialog_1">
		<text>I did. Two of them are fine. But the third one's a real pain in the ass. I don't know what's wrong with it yet, but it's giving off a weird signal. It's like a malfunction. I don't know. So here's what we're gonna do. Take the remote control and go to the area near where you set the radar. The most important thing is that you're in range. Try connecting directly to it and resetting the input settings.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_second_dialog_2">
		<text>You think that'll help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_second_dialog_22">
		<text>And you're sure it'll help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_second_dialog_3">
		<text>What other option do you have? Of course, if you have no problems, you can assemble a broken device, take it to the place where a working one is installed, open all the modules, check their settings on the working model ... Well, you get the idea. It'll take at least two days. So just do as I say.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_second_dialog_4">
		<text>All right.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_third_dialog_0">
		<text>Anyway, I reflashed it. I think it should give you the right values now. Check it out. Here's your tuning device.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_third_dialog_1">
		<text>Okay, okay, hold on, hold on. I'm just gonna do a quick system reset... Okay, uh... Okay. Whoa! There, that's good. It's working. Nice work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_third_dialog_2">
		<text>What are you gonna do with this whole system now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_third_dialog_22">
		<text>You got a surveillance system like you got a nuclear plant buried in here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_third_dialog_222">
		<text>The only thing I don't understand is why you need such a sophisticated surveillance system. What, are you tracking mutants from the swamp?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_third_dialog_3">
		<text>Well... First of all, it's not my whim. The warden said "we have to," I said "we have to." We're not poor and we're not greedy. You have no idea how much money there is riding on this -- artifact mining, mutant safaris... And that's just a small part of it. It's bigger than... I don't even know what's cooler than that. Harold's making money with excavators... And he's putting a lot of it into security. That's why most of the equipment here is like the private armies of Arabian sheikhs. To go cheap in this business is to put a bullet in your head. The slightest sign of weakness and that's it... Other clan rivals get stomped in the shit. And then there's the outlaws you got to go after...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_radist_quest_third_dialog_4">
		<text>All in all, I see where you're going with this. I don't really care about that, though. I did my job, I got my percentage. So long...</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_0">
		<text>Phew, we're off. Didn't think so. Don't hold it against me, Scout. That's not where you're looking for enemies. I'm here on my own interest and it's not my intention to cause any harm to your clan... Any questions? No problem, I'll answer...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_1">
		<text>You got away... Tell me about it. There are definitely questions. Only I can see you really don't want to hurt my faction. At least for now. And if you still do, I can't prove it yet. If you were a Naenik man, you'd have killed me as soon as we fought off the creatures. Not necessarily, but... All right, forget it, stalker. Answer me this. Why didn't you tell me about the dead mercenary?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_2">
		<text>I'm telling you, I've got an interest of my own in the Clear Skies clan. I'll use what leads I find in this case as I see fit. In which case, I have a counter question for you... Or even a suggestion. Help me investigate the disappearance of a group of purebreds and scientists in your area, and I'll try to resolve your internal contradictions in the grouping.</text>
  </string>	
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_3">
		<text>Wow, you're a sneaky stalker. Don't you have the guts to resolve such contradictions? Well, whatever. I can share the information. My guys spotted the Pistonebs. They were here about a week ago. Can't know where they are now. They've moved out of our territories and we've lost interest. Now about the scientists. Some can and will say they saw them here, others will say they didn't. I will tell you this - my people have not seen them. And if my scouts didn't see them, they weren't here. Take it any way you want...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_4">
		<text>That's how it is. All right, then. Thank you for the information.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_44">
		<text>Now that's interesting. Thank you for the information.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_5">
		<text>Oh, one more thing. Would it surprise you to learn that the mercenary you found wasn't a mercenary at all? </text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_6">
		<text>Should it? Honestly, I haven't decided whether to be surprised or not... What's going on here, anyway? Is there some kind of internal contradiction in the group or what? Why is Hasan your what do you call him, "fucking bitch"? What are the mercenaries doing here? </text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_7">
		<text>Huh, my friend - that's what I ultimately want to find out. Hasan's our deputy. He and Harold started this clan back in the day. Only, lately, they've been going their separate ways. We have a suspicion that Hasan is playing a double game and selling artifacts through left channels, bypassing Harold. Though we can't prove it yet. The mercenaries we're watching here probably work for him. Plus, he's got quite a few reliable people in the clan itself. Basically, our faction's splitting in two. My advice to you is stay out of this, stalker. You're just another pawn to be traded and forgotten.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_8">
		<text>Who knows, who knows. Could be a pawn, could be a queen. Either way, I don't care about your internal conflict. At least it won't care as long as it doesn't intersect with my case.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_88">
		<text>And pawns can checkmate the king. In any case, your internal conflict doesn't bother me. At least as long as it doesn't intersect with my interests.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_9">
		<text>Remember - it's in your interest that they don't overlap. However, I sense that's not possible. The corpse you found is one of the purebreds who was killed and disguised as a mercenary. I didn't want to tell you that. But you were going to find out sooner or later anyway. And if it's not a mercenary or a clan stalker, you deal with it.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_pred_dialog_10">

	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_first_dialog_0">
		<text>All right, we'll figure out the most important questions somehow. Anything else you need from me? Just not the clan squabbles. I wouldn't mind doing some more work.</text>

	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_first_dialog_1">
		<text>My group has two minor tasks left to complete. One is to measure radiation levels at a recent source of anomalous activity. The second task is to measure the activity of one of the chemical formations. If you want to do either one, you can do it.</text>

	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_first_dialog_2">

  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_first_dialog_3">
		<text>That's good. Here's a special radiometer. Be careful with it. Pretty expensive and rare around here. The instructions are inside. Go to the specified area and do what you need to do. Four measurements need to be taken. Good luck with that.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_first_dialog_4">

		<text>Well, if it is, then so be it. Honestly, I was hoping you'd do the radiation sweeps. We don't want to take any more doses ourselves. Yeah, well, whatever. Here, have a good old VPCR. I think you know how to handle it. Take samples from one anomaly and back. You got it?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_leader_second_quest_first_dialog_444">
		<text>Right, I'll do my best.</text>

		<text>We can put you in touch with our commander. That's a good idea. Maybe he could use you for something. If you don't ask too many questions. Or play the part of the stalker we're waiting for. That's an idea. I've had enough of standing around waiting for the weather with the boys. Well, that's a joke, of course.

  </string>

		<text>Everyone has something they want. And not everyone wants exactly what you said they wanted. Money, whores, it's an overabundance. Any motherfucker with a machine gun can get his hands on it. But honor and respect... Are you really stupid enough to think it'll do you any good?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_init_dialog_6">

  </string>
	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_init_dialog_9">
		<text>Remember. All you're gonna find here is a pain in the ass. Yeah, well, whatever. You're here on your own or on a tip from someone else, it doesn't matter. Take your pick. You can either take out the undead swamp nest or clear out the other mutants, the more dangerous ones.</text>

		<text>Good. I'm glad you're less stupid than I thought. Here's the thing. The artifact collectors ran into some strange creatures. I don't know what the hell it was, but all the guys died. I don't know what those scouts were looking at when they checked the area. But that ain't all. A couple of men died in that area recently, too. And they all disappeared at night. Fools themselves - they shouldn't have been wandering around the Zone at night. One of them was even said to be from a different grouping - "Clear Sky" or something like that. So it is not known whether you were right to take up this particular case. But in any case, don't be afraid. If you want to, you can go there with someone else.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_init_dialog_13">
		<text>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you say purebred? I'll take the job alone. I don't need any help.</text>

		<text>Huh, I see you're not all about whores and fame after all... All right, that's your right, stalker. About the purebred, we'll talk after the job's done. About the help, I wouldn't say no if I were you. Think it over. Could use an extra gun in this case. Anyway, I'll have a squad of my boys nearby. You're going with them now, by the way. Finist is in charge there. He'll tell you more about what they are and where they've been seen. And no buts. Get some better gear. All right, get out of my sight.</text>

	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_init_dialog_112">
		<text>Boy, have you thought this through? I think I did. I won't talk you out of it. It's your choice. Anyway, those things came here at night. No, not the base. They were close to it. But very close. We were three men down in the morning. But that ain't all. There's been a recent visit by the purebreds. One of their men was gone too, but for another 24 hours. And again at night. Scouts tracked them down. They didn't engage. Scouts seldom engage at all. They called out the approximate area the creatures were coming from. And they had some kind of psi powers. So be real careful. </text>

About the purebred, we'll talk after you do the job - if you do it and come back, of course. So don't think about him now. Yeah, one more thing. There are other hunters headed to that area. So you probably won't be alone. Or maybe you'll be alone. Get some better gear. All right, get out of my sight.</text>

	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_frog_1_dialog_3">
		<text>He told me to follow you. Whether you can handle it or not. Said you were willing to take care of it yourself. That's why me and my boys won't get in your way. You want to die, die. But if you do everything right, come back, I've got one request to make of you. I forgot, the nest is somewhere near the abandoned farm. It's not far from here.

  </string>
	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_frog_2_dialog_3">
		<text>No, I don't think so. They're more likely. Fish lizards we've never seen around here either. We should go and get one of the bodies and get it back to Amber for the scientists.

		<text>Yeah, I'm sure he was. Just like I'm talking to you now, and I'm talking to him. Well, if it's later about the job, it's later. Although, you could have given me a hint as to what needs to be done.</text>

	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_polter_end_dialog_0">
		<text>All in all, it's done. Those things have been destroyed. They were really dangerous devils. But I met them once in the dungeons of Agroyantar. So there wasn't much of a problem.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_polter_end_dialog_1">
		<text>All right. You'll get paid. Sure there wasn't a problem? Is there anything else you want to tell me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_polter_end_dialog_2">
		<text>Yeah, there is. There's nothing more to tell me. On the contrary, I'm hoping you'll tell me something on my subject.</text>

	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_polter_end_dialog_22">

  </string>
	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_polter_end_dialog_3">
		<text>I will, don't worry. Anyway... Here's the thing. One of my best bands is missing. It's in the area where you worked. No witnesses. So while I've decided to shut down the shop a little bit, all the safaris are shutting down for fun. Sure you didn't see anything out of the ordinary?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_hunter_first_quest_polter_end_dialog_4">
		<text>Yeah, I'm sure. Like I said, I didn't see anyone, so I didn't see anyone.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Hiya, mate. You a local mechanic? I'm Varg, a freelance stalker from Agroyantar. I'm looking for a job before I settle down. Can you offer me something for a seasoned handyman?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_1">
		<text>Hello to you, too. Hands-on and experienced, you say? That's good. You familiar with the technique? Doesn't have to be a jack-of-all-trades. The main thing for me is that he's not a handyman. At least he can hold a screwdriver in his hands.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_2">
		<text>You're insulting me, friend. I'd be walking around the Zone if I wasn't such a handyman. I'd have been buried in the nearest anomaly a long time ago.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_3">
		<text>All right, then. Let's hope I'm not lying. Of course, I don't care if it's not you or someone else who does the work. But the time it takes is worth the money. Or your life. So don't be angry later. And the job will be of the next type. I, as a clan technician, need to make preparations for procurement for the clan. That is, to select the most appropriate equipment, consumables, etc. Now there is a dilemma, which is better to buy a large batch of uniforms. You choose what you want to do. You can take up testing of gas masks. Or you can test the performance of wearable radios. It's important I get the results of the tests to determine which sample to order for the faction's supply units.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_4">
		<text>I'll take up testing the gas masks. After all, that's a lot closer to a stalker right now.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_44">
		<text>I'd rather work on the walkie-talkies. I used to be an E.O.E. graduate in the military. It's my specialty.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_5">
		<text>Suit yourself. So here's the plan. In a backpack nearby, you'll take all the equipment you need. Then you'll prepare five samples for testing. You'll do the testing in a specially equipped tent. You know how gas masks are tested in the army. They put soldiers in a tent with chloropicrin and check if the filters work properly and if the helmet doesn't leak gas. Afterwards, you come to me and give me the results. After that, you come to me and give me the results. If you don't, you don't get the money.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_6">
		<text>Don't worry. Get your blood money ready. I'll make it.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_55">
		<text>Suit yourself. Here's the deal. I give you five samples of different radios. You go to the specified area and check out how they're picking up the signal. You bring the results back to me. Our radio operator will supervise that, too.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_66">
		<text>Okay, no problem.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_first_dialog_22">
		<text>Yeah. That sounds like a lot of work. I guess I'll come back later.</text>
  </string>
	
	
	<string id="topi_mechanic_razia_quest_end_dialog_0">
		<text>Job done. That turned out to be pretty easy. </text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_razia_quest_end_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, you're the one who made it look so smooth and fluffy. Some people can't even do the simplest task. Well done, lad. If I get any more business, I'll let you know. By the way, have you considered joining our clan? We need guys like that. I could put in a good word for you with my superiors.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_razia_quest_end_dialog_2">
		<text>Yeah, I thought about it at first. But I got my own business to take care of first. Then you never know.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_razia_quest_end_dialog_22">
		<text>I had that idea. But I need to get my affairs in order first. Then we'll see.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_razia_quest_end_dialog_3">
		<text>Your business? Well, maybe I can help you out. If you need any technical help, don't hesitate to come over. We'll do it in the best way. By the way, if you're interested in more work, come over at night. After three o'clock. If you're interested, of course.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_razia_quest_end_dialog_4">
		<text>Thanks, man. I'll keep that in mind.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_second_dialog_0">
		<text>Gas masks checked out. Test results are in. That's it? All the work?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah. Isn't that enough for you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_second_dialog_2">
		<text>Well, kind of, yeah. I wish there was more to it. I mean, you didn't even have to leave the base.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_second_dialog_22">
		<text>Yeah. You always want more. This one didn't even have to leave the base.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Huh. You're a punk-ass stalker. He wants more than that. A lot of people would be lucky to have a job where they don't have to risk their ass. You like risk, get a job with a hunter or a supply runner or a scout. They'll make sure you're as extreme as your tonsils. That's all I can offer you. If you're interested in more work, come back after 3:00 a.m.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_second_dialog_4">
		<text>All right, don't be a grumpy old man. I'll keep that in mind.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_third_dialog_0">
		<text>Listen, man. I'm in a little bit of trouble here. I got in trouble. I didn't have time to finish all the samples.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_third_dialog_1">
		<text>What's up? Where'd you say you screwed up? You're an asshole. I knew it, didn't I? What kind of people are coming to the Zone now - I'm flying away from you. Autistic fucks. How do you still live? Well, why are you standing there staring and blinking your eyes? Huh, son of a whore? Give me the equipment. You're not supposed to have anything in your hands.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_third_dialog_2">
		<text>Here, take it. It's no big deal. I'll make it up to you. Not everybody gets everything right all at once. Technique takes skill... All I've been doing for the last six months is shooting mutants and crawling around anomalies.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_mechanic_proto_quest_third_dialog_3">
		<text>You still here? Well, fuck it. Maybe you're good at something else. But don't expect any more work from me. I can't even trust you to take out a bucket of garbage.</text>

		<text>All right. Don't be grumpy.</text>

	<string id="topi_i1_anubis_yad_quest_dialog_1">
		<text>Don't make a fuss. I'll give you an injection. If you move, you'll be dead in a few minutes. I barely got to you in time as it is. Here... You'll be all right now. Feeling better?</text>

		<text>A stalker from the Freedom faction. That's good enough for you for now. And don't worry - I've got no beef with you about that mess with us and the Dhole groups. Would I be rescuing you now? What, you didn't crack open the mercenary stash?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_anubis_yad_quest_dialog_4">
		<text>Yeah. Wait, how did you know that?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_anubis_yad_quest_dialog_44">
		<text>What? How do you know that?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_anubis_yad_quest_dialog_5">
		<text>I know a lot of things. You're not the first person to fall for their poisoned stash trick. They fill it with gas. There's no chance of surviving without special equipment. But you're one of the survivors. With my help, of course.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_anubis_yad_quest_dialog_6">
		<text>Thank you. Ask for whatever you want-- artifacts, money. I'll give you anything.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_anubis_yad_quest_dialog_7">
		<text>I'll ask. But not now... For now, you must go to the base and see a doctor. Tell him you inhaled fumes from the chemical anomaly. He'll fix your health. I'll check in with you when I need to. And let's not ask too many questions just yet.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_anubis_yad_quest_dialog_8">
		<text>All right, then.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_anubis_yad_quest_dialog_88">
		<text>Whatever you say.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_0">
		<text>Hey, I need your help. I got into a chemical anomaly. I've been inhaling all kinds of gases. Can you take a look? I took some anabolics, but I still feel like shit.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_1">
		<text>You said an anomaly, so let's take a look. Dude, aren't you lying to me? Where did you find such an anomaly, which causes damage as a very curious COV. And you don't really need to be cured. You've already been cured. So where did you run into them?</text>
  </string>	
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_2">
		<text>I told you, I walked into an anomaly.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_22">
		<text>Why would I lie? It's the first time I've ever seen an anomaly like that.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_3">
		<text>That's why you're being so vague, isn't it? Let's just not lie to each other... Yeah? I've seen your kind before in my time. More than once. But they were usually all dead by then. It's a mercenary thing, boy. Where'd you see the blues?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_4">
		<text>I ain't seen 'em. I only found one body. He had papers that pointed to the location of their stash. I found it, but I couldn't open it. And recently, when I was working for Vazgen, I ran into a posse of bandits. One of them told me about a stash like that before he died. He told me the code. And the code worked. And after that, you already know. A fucking surprise stash.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_5">
		<text>Yeah, it's a familiar situation. A mercenary stash. Bandits who attack our pickers have access to it. My friend, don't you think you're getting in the wrong business? And now you're associating with forces that will destroy you at any opportunity?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_6">
		<text>What are you talking about?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_66">
		<text>What are you talking about right now?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_7">
		<text>Nothing. I'm just thinking out loud. And I have some wise advice to give. You're a smart man, aren't you, Varg? Stay out of this mercenary business if you want to live. Get the hint, or shall I put it another way?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_8">
		<text>You work for the syndicate?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_9">
		<text>What do you think I'd do if I was working for the syndicate and they found out? Probably shoot you now. But as you can see, I'm still talking to you. No, my friend. I don't work for the syndicate. But some of our people in the clan happen to do business with them. And I, you know, want to protect you. Spare you an unnecessary headache, so to speak. Once again, Varg, they're gonna eat you alive. Stop and mind your own business. I seem to remember you've been fishing for information from the cleaners. Keep looking for your feathered friends and stay out of this.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_i1_medic_yad_quest_dialog_10">
		<text>I can't do that, man. These cases are all connected by the same thread. You pull one, another one comes along. So I'll take care of it myself. Thank you for your concern. I can handle it if I'm lucky. Take care.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Hello, Vazgen. I got word you're looking for a man for a certain job. I can take the job, if it's still relevant.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_first_dialog_1">
		<text>You, you say? I don't see why not. A lot of our boys told me you're pretty good at hard work. You know, taking measurements, testing equipment. That's why I won't give you dumb little tasks that even a locksmith can do. But I won't give you a serious job either. I've got my own trusted people for that. You may be really cool, but you still need to earn your trust.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_first_dialog_2">
		<text>So what if I do?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_first_dialog_22">
		<text>I'll come back later. I don't want to hear your bullshit just yet. If you've got something to say, say it. Don't drag it out...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_first_dialog_3">
		<text>It's okay. You'll work. Specifically, I'm interested in the artifact supply in this hole. I don't care about the rest. Deliveries and the people involved in finding the artifacts are our priority. Don't look at me like I'm just a simple merchant, yeah. No artifacts, no trade. And the people who mine the artifacts stand apart from us. Every skilled collector counts. We work hard to train our young, but...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_first_dialog_4">
		<text>Look, can you be more specific? What do you want from me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_first_dialog_5">
		<text>Wah, you're impatient, aren't you? Why are you interrupting Vazgen for nothing? Vazgen has to tell you everything in order. If you want it short, make it short. An unpleasant thing happened recently. An experienced collector, who'd been in the clan since its inception, was killed. He was killed by two faggots, in a bad way. By their own pickpicks. Shot like the last bitches in the back. Took all the loot and lay low somewhere nearby. Rumor has it a few more men have joined them and it's already a small gang. Scouts have already tracked them down. The only problem is to eliminate them. It's got to be done quickly and clearly. Otherwise this little gang could give us a lot of trouble. Bastards won't go to the base, but they know some of the picker and other caravan routes. You know they'll start robbing. And if they get the idea to join a bigger gang and bring them here, it's a real bummer. So get your hands on your feet and go. You see... Only one of our task forces is gonna have your back.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_first_dialog_6">
		<text>All right, I'd be happy to do that. I'll take care of the bastards.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_wounded_dialog_0">
		<text>Stalker, give me a hand. Got the olive. Brother... the first aid kit, I'll never forget it...</text>

  </string>
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_wounded_dialog_2">
		<text>Five of us. There was no one else. Me and my mate tried to escape as soon as we heard the shooting. He wasn't even my boy. He was a mercenary, I think. And he fucking shot me on purpose and got away...</text>

  </string>
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_wounded_dialog_4">
		<text>There was a stash house nearby. He was supposed to pick up an order from there... He's on his way to the farm now. Stalker, help me, please. I've told you everything I know...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_wounded_dialog_5">
		<text>I'm already helping you...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_wounded_dialog_11">
		<text>No, you bitch. I'd rather watch you die.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_prisoner_dialog_0">
		<text>What the hell are you looking at? Go on, ask your goddamn questions and get it over with as soon as you can...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_prisoner_dialog_1">
		<text>What's the matter, you can't wait to die? Don't worry, we won't hurt you. We ain't talking to you for long. Really, only if you answer quickly and clearly everything I ask you. If you don't want to talk, you will die very slowly. Do you understand me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_prisoner_dialog_2">
		<text>Yes, stalker. Only I'm not a mercenary. But I've been working for them. Used to be a freelancer, but not of the clan. I joined this gang for the money. And I got something to say.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_prisoner_dialog_3">
		<text>So, I'm gonna have four questions. First, the stash house where you were supposed to get some kind of order. That's where you were headed. I need the code. Two - what's the blue's connection to the local clan and whose body were they trying to pass off as their dead fighter we found here at the farm? Third, what does Hasan have to do with this case? His name appears in the documents I found. And lastly, is the Clear Skies clan connected to the mercenaries?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_prisoner_dialog_4">
		<text>Well, you asked, too. I'll tell you what I know. What I don't know, I'm sorry. The code to the stash house is 5683. We didn't go there to pick up an order, we went there to get payment for a job done. Mercenaries, you know, they hire their own mercenaries, too. Blue's connected to the local clan through Hassan. Just the man you asked about. They got their own thing going on there, stalker. I wasn't really privy to that. Our specific assignment was to kill one of the artifact collectors who was carrying a very rare commodity. Hasan gave the mercenaries a lead on him. We were just the enforcers. The mercenaries were facilitators. It's possible Hasan's moving fake artifacts through the mercenaries, ripping off his own fellow soldiers. But that's just my guess. I don't know anything about a dead body. That's the first I'm hearing from you. Maybe just some stalker killed, but why they did it - I do not know. I don't know about Clear Skies, either. Though, wait - I heard the mercenaries say that they'd killed one of the Pure Sky guys around here. But whether that's true, I can't say. That's all I know. Stalker - I know you're going to kill me, please - do it quickly.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b7_trader_quest_1_bandit_prisoner_dialog_5">
		<text>I will...</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_second_dialog_0">
		<text>It's done. Bandits and locksmiths eliminated. One of them was a former freelance stalker. I managed to interrogate him.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_second_dialog_1">
		<text>What did he say? Don't keep me in suspense.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_second_dialog_2">
		<text>Vazgen - you're a strange man, you're not Russian, but you speak without an accent when you want to.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Don't talk to me like that. Come on, tell me what the fuck he told you...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_second_dialog_4">
		<text>Nothing much. He said they're out to kill one of your pickers, who's recently taken a mound and found a very rare artefact. Some mercenary gave them the tip.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_second_dialog_44">
		<text>Nothing noteworthy. Said they agreed to take down one of the gatherers, who had recently found a rare artifact. Some mercenary tipped them off.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_second_dialog_5">
		<text>Okay. Let's get you to forget about what he told you, yes. It's better for all of us. And I'll pay you extra for your silence. And don't worry, not with lead, though I admit it'd be cheaper. I'm gonna need you for something else. So don't poison the compote, respect. By the way, go see our artifact specialist. He might have another job for you. Once you're done with him, come back to me.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_1_quest_second_dialog_6">
		<text>I hope you weren't lying.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_0">
		<text>And what other business did you have for me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_1">
		<text>I knew you'd be interested. You're not an easy man, Varg. Anyway, this is a follow-up to that thing you just broke.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_2">
		<text>I'm listening. What else do you need resolved?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_22">
		<text>I think I'll get to it later. I'm not in the mood for any more...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Here's the deal. Again, security is the key to making our business thrive. When security's at stake, nothing else matters. You lost one of those gangsters, Varg. And now the wise Vazgen will have to figure out how to cover our asses.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_4">
		<text>You lost? There was only five of them. The bandits themselves told me there were five.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_44">
		<text>What do you mean, you missed them? There were five. I took out four of them. The fifth was taken out by your men. The bandits themselves said there were only five of them.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_5">
		<text>And you believed them? Don't disappoint me, my friend. My little birdie amongst the scouts said they saw six. The sixth one left an hour before you arrived at their anchorage. Three you killed at once, two headed for the hiding place. As soon as they heard the gunfire one of them deliberately shot the other to distract you and tried to escape, heading for the farm. That's where the action team caught him. And the sixth one, on the sly, got the hell out of our controlled territory.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_6">
		<text>What am I supposed to do, go looking for this bastard over three nines? How was I supposed to know there were six?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_7">
		<text>You wouldn't. But you know that now. And you also know that this bastard was in on the gang's business, maybe even their leader. And if he knew about the gang, he knows about the rare artifact collector. And if he joins a major gang, we're in a lot more trouble. The artifact our man found is the Devil's Egg. Only three have been found in the history of the Zone. It's worth, like, a couple million bucks. Do you think the bandits will want it? I think they will.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_8">
		<text>That's a hell of a deal. Anyway, what am I supposed to do?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_88">
		<text>That's an unexpected twist. So what am I supposed to do now?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_9">
		<text>This man's likely to go after the renegades. They're a gang that can't be negotiated with. They're a dumb and uncontrollable force driven only by the lust for profit. And it's in our power to make them move in another direction, not our clan. Look. Now you will take these documents and artifacts. You're gonna put these documents in one cache. Then they'll be taken care of and the information will reach the right ears. And with the artifacts, you go to meet the other gang... You tell them it's from Vazgen. If they want more, they need to contact Gogi. Then you come back here. You got it?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_10">
		<text>Do I need to know what's in that bag of papers?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_11">
		<text>No. But I will. It'll make sure you don't get away with it, otherwise we'll just destroy you. The packet's a fake. It's a real lie, all right. A trusted member of the outlaws will be informed that the collector who found the Devil's Egg is out on the moor - trying to sell it through Clear Sky. </text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_12">
		<text>You're trying to frame Clear Skies?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_13">
		<text>Yeah. Nothing personal, purely business, as they say. Renegade units will move to the marshes instead of coming here. They make some noise, they don't find anything, they go back. And everybody wins. Oh, by the way, I'm well aware that you work for Clear Skies. You don't have to worry about that. We'll help you with your case in exchange for this favor. Oh, and get this. The bandits you're going to meet later are just a distraction. They'll probably try to kill you. So be prepared to shoot back. It's even to our advantage if they attack you...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_14">
		<text>I'm not quite sure why you're meeting with bandits...</text>
  </string>	
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_141">
		<text>I don't quite understand your intentions...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_142">
		<text>I don't understand your logic. Why do you have to play this out?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_first_dialog_15">
		<text>And you need to understand why we're playing this farce. Just play your part, that's all.</text>

  </string>
	<string id="topi_a6_trader_quest_2_bandit_dialog_4">
		<text>What the hell did you say? You're the one who's dead here, dickhead. We'll take your head to Vazgen, understand?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a6_trader_quest_2_bandit_dialog_5">
		<text>Try it...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a6_trader_quest_2_bandit_dialog_33">
		<text>Here's the art. Do I need to give something to Vazgen?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a6_trader_quest_2_bandit_dialog_44">
		<text>No, we'll give him your head ourselves.</text>

		<text>Try it...</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_0">
		<text>Listen, you fucking cocksucker, what's all this shit? These thugs were just hired to kill me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Huh, you got some nerve, boy. That's all right. I hope you realize you've learned too much unnecessary and dangerous stuff.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_2">
		<text>So you just decided to get rid of me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_22">
		<text>And you thought you'd just get rid of me? This way?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Well, you didn't get rid of me. As you can see, you're still alive. And alive because as soon as the bandits opened fire, someone took out two of them. Any idea who it might have been and whose tip he was using? If not, then shut your mouth and listen. Things aren't as rosy as you think, stalker. You're in some pretty big shit, and it ain't easy to get out of it alive. So you listen to what I have to say, and you take it from there...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_4">
		<text>Well, what exactly are you gonna say?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_5">
		<text>The founder of the clan, Harold, has a serious conflict with his deputy Hasan. Hassan is playing his own game and dreams of removing Harold and taking his place. Hassan is the mastermind behind all the strange things that have been going on here lately. Well, almost all of them. He works with mercenaries, and they help him carry out his plans. You've been sniffing around on Clear Skies and you've unwittingly come up with Hassan.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_6">
		<text>What am I supposed to do? The most important thing for me is to get the job done.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_7">
		<text>There are two options here. Since you survived the assassination attempt, either you help convince Harold that Hassan only works for himself, or the opposite, you offer your services to Hassan. You know what kind of fee to ask of them. They can both do what you need them to do. So, it's up to you. But you must understand the level of risk. Hasan won't kill you in front of everyone, at the same time Harold can't take out Hasan without any evidence.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_8">
		<text>Wait, how do you know all this...?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_88">
		<text>And how do you know this...?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_888">
		<text>How the fuck do you know about this...?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_9">
		<text>Birds are singing everywhere, my friend. You just have to know how to listen. You don't have to care who the wise Vazgen works for, just listen to his advice, that's all. Otherwise, you won't be met by simple bandits next time...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_trader_2_quest_second_dialog_10">
		<text>I got it. Thank you. Good luck...</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Hello, Hasan. I have business to talk to you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_1">
		<text>Take care, too. Come in now that you're here. I've heard about your latest business. There's a lot of talk about you around here.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_2">
		<text>Only good things, I hope.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_22">
		<text>Do they even say good things?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Maybe. I haven't decided yet. They say you've done a good job working for the people of the clan, and you've done a lot of good for our cause. They also say you've started asking questions... Some pretty, uh, dangerous questions. Answers to which could have unpleasant consequences for both of us. There's also talk that you survived the opening of a booby-trapped mercenary cache and easily dispatched several small gangs. You're quite a dangerous man, Varg, and could certainly make a profitable business partner. Or not... So, I'm listening...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_4">
		<text>A business partnership is a good and indispensable thing. I've heard a lot about you too, Hasan. Then again - I haven't decided whether it's good or bad either. Some people are not happy that you didn't allow the farm to be occupied and are likely to use the place as an agreed-upon meeting point with your mercenary associates. And I have some documentation to back up those concerns. And I've also heard that you hire small groups of bandits that some divisive people tip off to rob your own artifact collectors. This allows you, through those same mercenaries, to sell artifacts to bypass the clan coffers. Dangerous stuff, isn't it? I shudder to think what would happen if word got out...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_5">
		<text>I'm beginning to like you... You know damn well I can't just kill you right here. Surely, in the event of your sudden death, some stalker will hand over the documents you found to Harold, which isn't necessary in any way. Just like you can't just go ahead and kill me. And since you know all this and come to me, you're hoping to demand a higher price for your silence? Who hired you to work against me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_6">
		<text>You're right about almost everything. Except for one thing. I wasn't hired to work against you. I don't care about your clan or the machinations that go on here. But I can work for you and do you some favours. All these dangerous things have become available to me in the course of fulfilling my order from the Clear Sky faction. My client is interested in the fate of their missing squad, as well as the group of scientific stalkers who appeared here shortly before them. I can forget what I know, as well as silence those who still know it in exchange for full information on my case...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_7">
		<text>And there you have it. Well, this could be a game changer... Well, if it all goes smoothly in the end, I have nothing to lose. I might even win. Of course, that's blackmail on your part, but I wouldn't want to choose the other option. It's less of a win-win for both of us. So, I'm in. You help me eliminate all those who displease me, and in return I will give you full information on the case of the disappeared scientists, and ensure your meeting with the contact of the client's clan.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_8">
		<text>It's a deal.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_88">
		<text>All right, then. I'll do it.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_9">
		<text>What do you suggest we do? From what I understand from your story, the scout leader is in my way - he's Harold's confidant. His death shouldn't raise questions or make me suspicious. Basically, there's a plan I've already thought of... Poisoning, a skirmish with mercenaries or a rare mutant. Lots of different possibilities. Poisoning seems to me to be the best option. At least it'll really clean up loose ends.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_10">
		<text>Exactly. And I know a way to do it without attracting attention. Tell the scout to wait for me in the area, and he'll get further instructions and equipment from me. Hint to him that he will have to test the new batch of gas masks at the anomaly site. Your supply man or mechanic should get me some components.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_11">
		<text>My man, the mechanic - he'll make all the arrangements. I understand you've decided to poison them with gas masks. I've considered that, but there could be traces. It's a realistic way to trace us. And keep in mind, my men will be watching the operation.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_12">
		<text>They won't. And they won't find anyone. If the pre-prepared catalyst works like clockwork. Prepare the intel I'm interested in. We'll talk about it when I get back.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_0">
		<text>Hey. I'm from Hasan. You should know what I want by now.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_1">
		<text>Oh, that's it. Well, yeah, I'm aware of that. I do have some questions, though.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_2">
		<text>What kind of questions?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_22">
		<text>What kind of questions?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_3">
		<text>Well, the gas masks are pretty clear. I've got them, I've got the filters. But the rest of the components... How shall I put it? I'm not quite sure what their purpose is. You cannot make them work without special substances that act as catalysts. And these catalysts can be several components at once. And again - depending on the task at hand.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_4">
		<text>I hear you. What can I say about it. I need hydroquinone placed in a spray capsule.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_5">
		<text>Oh, that's it. I see what you need it for, then. There you go. Say hello to Hasan for me. Tell him it's done in the best possible way.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_6">
		<text>I will.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_scaut_dialog_0">
		<text>Cheers. So we meet again.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_scaut_dialog_1">
		<text>Good day to you, too. I see you're working for Hassan now? Didn't expect that. What further instructions did he ask for?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_scaut_dialog_2">
		<text>No shit, I remember that conversation we had. It's just a one-time job, just to make some money. And I'm just a regular messenger. But you know I didn't just take the job for nothing. He didn't give me any specific orders. He said, give them gas masks from new batch and let them run through especially evil anomalies. Then they'll buy a bigger batch.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_scaut_dialog_3">
		<text>Well, if that's really the case, good. I thought you'd become one of his trusted men. By the way, I got some new information for you. Remember that dead mercenary? I told you the other day it was a purebred corpse. Well, it was indeed the body of a fighter from their clan. Hassan's men took him out. He was in the squad you were trying to track down. I don't know the fate of the rest of the unit.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_scaut_dialog_4">
		<text>Good. Thank you. You watch out for the anomalies out there. Better go to the chem lab. It's just around the corner.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_scaut_dialog_44">
		<text>Okay. You be careful at the anomalies, by the way. You'd better go to the chemist, which is nearby.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_scaut_dialog_5">
		<text>Yeah, that's where we're going. All right, take care. Don't get too close to Hasan, though. Harold's already got some leads on him. He's about to expose him and heads will roll. So make sure you don't lose yours.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_scaut_dialog_6">
		<text>I'll do my best. You bet.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_0">
		<text>It's done. The scout troop has been eliminated. Your observers made sure of that?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Yes, Varg. I've already received confirmation. Well done. I must admit, I didn't expect you to be so coldly calculating.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_2">
		<text>What else did you expect?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_22">
		<text>What else couldn't you have expected?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_3">
		<text>I didn't expect you to come to me instead of Harold.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_4">
		<text>Yeah. I thought you didn't expect me to survive the opening of that stash...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_5">
		<text>Not without that. But we don't choose another man's path, we just steer him in the right direction. OK, let's decide on your subject now. I can't wait to end this story once and for all.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_zam_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_6">
		<text>Yeah, let's do it.</text>
  </string>
	 
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Hey. I have some very important information that might interest you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_1">
		<text>And hello to you, too. I've heard about your recent dealings, Varg. You've been a big help to our group. But I hope your information is serious enough for you to come to me directly?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_2">
		<text>More than that. It concerns your deputy Hassan. It's likely that this man is playing his own game here. He has something to do with the mercenaries your scouts saw recently. He most likely sells stolen artifacts through them. In addition, he's had a number of outlaw groups operating under his leadership, which is exactly what's been getting these artifacts from your gatherers on Hassan's tip. So the mercenaries, the bandits are all links in the same chain that lead to Hasan.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Yeah, stalker. I honestly expected something like this. But not this much. Hasan's really changed lately. We had our suspicions he had something to do with the recent events. The gangsters were working very cleanly - obviously on a tip-off from one of our rats. But for that rat to be Hassan? I'm having a hard time believing that even now. I need hard evidence to back up what you're saying. I can't just accuse him of treason and shoot him. That would lead to a clan split and a massacre. And that would ruin our business. But if we get proof of his guilt, that changes everything. Besides, what I can't figure out is what's in it for you? Why would you help me and rat out my deputy's dirty work?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_4">
		<text>My angle is simple. Quid pro quo. I'm here for a reason. Your clan's affairs don't really interest me, frankly. But a group of scientists and a squad of Clear Skies sent for their souls went missing recently in your controlled territory. I need full information on this case. And I think you're the only one who can give it to me. On Hassan, I have some evidence. Some documents, plus my findings are shared by your scout commander. He suspected Hassan of associating with mercenaries after he refused to take over the farms. Most likely he was using them for some purpose of his own. Afterwards I found the mercenary's dead body in that area. I was also able to interrogate one of the bandits. He claimed that information about the routes of your pickers was passed on to them by some high ranking man from your clan.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_5">
		<text>Scout leader you say. You know, he won't be able to confirm any of your concerns. </text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_6">
		<text>Why is that?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_7">
		<text>He died with his group under very strange circumstances. Their whole group was found dead near an anomaly. They were there testing new equipment - gas masks from a procurement batch. We don't understand what killed them. More precisely, who might have killed them - the zone or the humans had a hand in it. So here's what we do. If, as you say, Limp could have interfered with Hasan, then it makes sense to assume he was involved in his death. Makes sense? I suppose so. That's why we need to look for any trace of him. Maybe it was a psi hit, a poison gas or something else. Three highly experienced scouts couldn't just die in a chemical anomaly.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_8">
		<text>All right, I'll get on it... I already have some thoughts on that. I'll need some equipment. Which of your people can I count on as my own?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_9">
		<text>Go to the supply man in that case. He's entirely my man. You do the right thing, then we'll talk about the scientists and their feathered friends.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_10">
		<text>All right, then. See ya.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_first_dialog_101">
		<text>I got it. Bye-bye.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_snab_dialog_0">
		<text>Hi. I'm from Harold. He said you could give me your full cooperation on a delicate matter. First, tell me, where did you get the gas masks from the last shipment? Well, they were given to the dead scouts for field testing.</text>
  </string>	
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_snab_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, they were given to our technicians. They were supposed to have them ready for distribution to the clan. Why? Does it matter?</text>

	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_snab_dialog_2">
		<text>Yeah, it does. That's not all. I need special equipment. A spectrometer. I know it's pretty rare, but still. You guys don't sell artifacts for a dime, either.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_snab_dialog_3">
		<text>You're right about that. Not for three. I have a spectrometer, but what do you need it for? What are you going to investigate?</text>

	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_snab_dialog_4">
		<text>The spot where your scouts died.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_snab_dialog_44">
		<text>The place where your scouts died.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_snab_dialog_5">
		<text>Wait, so you don't think their deaths were an accident?</text>
  </string>	
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_snab_dialog_6">
		<text>I don't think, I want to find out. Thanks for the equipment. I'll get it back to Harold in one piece. Bye.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_0">
		<text>Hey there, tech guy. Anything you want to tell me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_1">
		<text>What's your problem? I don't owe you anything. Get the fuck... Get out of here.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_2">
		<text>Well, I think you're gonna owe me a lot. I'm from Harold. Tell me, did you give the scout leader a batch of gas masks to test?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_3">
		<text>I did. What's the problem? It's not the first time a batch has been given to a scout leader for pre-testing. What's the problem?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_4">
		<text>Well, the problem is that the masks were contaminated with a specific poisonous substance that reacted with another substance when the stalkers approached the anomaly. There is almost no trace left, but there is still some. Another twenty-four hours and I would have been late. But, as you can see, I still made it. And I can say that it was you who prepared the contaminated batch with which the scouts were killed. Your choice. You confess and tell me who ordered it, you die quickly. If you keep screwing around, I don't envy you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_5">
		<text>I didn't give them anything. All I did was check the filters and give them a spare set. And that wasn't for them, that was for the local delivery boy. He's just the errand boy for a little errand.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_6">
		<text>Whose messenger, Hassan's or Harold's?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_66">
		<text>I don't understand. Whose man was the messenger?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_7">
		<text>He's Hassan's man. Listen, Varg, don't kill me, I'll tell you what I know. Hassan set this whole thing up. He wanted to eliminate Limp. He got in his way a lot. And I'll give up his accomplices from the clan. I'll tell them, I swear on my mother.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_8">
		<text>What kind of accomplices? Stalkers or what?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_9">
		<text>Yeah, stalkers. They've got a meeting place. They share a cache with Hasan. I'll text you the coordinates. Just don't kill them.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_tehnik_dialog_10">
		<text>All right, live, bitch. Just breathe when I tell you to. And you will work for me from now on. If you tell Hasan I was here now, I think you get the hint... Sit there, you bastard, dry your trousers.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_0">
		<text>Anyway, I managed to figure it out.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Come on, don't be stalling. Speak if you have something to say.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_2">
		<text>As you suspected, the scouts were killed. They were poisoned with some pretty rare chemicals. One half was in the filters of their gas masks. The catalyst somehow went off near the anomaly. Within twenty-four hours all traces of the reaction would have evaporated and no one would have found the ends. I deduced that the gas masks were given to the group by Hassan's man. The tech swears he didn't put anything in them. He's lying. He gave up all of Hasan's clan associates. As soon as I tried to approach them, they opened fire to kill. I had to eliminate them. But I've opened their hideout and the records we found there prove Hassan's direct culpability.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_3">
		<text>That's great news, Varg. You got him, you rat. You can take him by the scruff of the neck and shoot him. The men of the group shouldn't have any more questions.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_4">
		<text>What about the tech? He's his man. He might not even be the only one. Surely there were others involved in the scheme.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_44">
		<text>And what about the rest of his men? Maybe they're expendable, too.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_5">
		<text>That's not so important. The main thing is to decapitate the enemy. The other pawns won't be able to do anything else. And I won't be able to find a new technician quickly. So let him live for now. If anything, he'll go after Hasan. All right, I need to give orders and prepare for Hasan's liquidation. And I may need you for that as well.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_lider_variant_quest_1_second_dialog_6">
		<text>That's good. But now my case needs to be solved.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a3_suget_quest_3_svayznoy_dialog_0">
		<text>You're my contact? May I ask what's taking you so long to get in touch?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a3_suget_quest_3_svayznoy_dialog_1">
		<text>No, man, I'm the monolith's contact. Or do you see anyone else here? Contacting you, what for? Did you find the scientists or our missing group? I don't think so. What was the point of talking to you, listening to your snot?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a3_suget_quest_3_svayznoy_dialog_2">
		<text>Some of the information I dug up pretty quickly... I had to give it to you and I was hoping there'd be some new instructions.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a3_suget_quest_3_svayznoy_dialog_3">
		<text>New instructions? My friend, you're not in the army. I'm not a sergeant, you're not an enlisted man. You were given an assignment, you signed up for it. We care about results, that's all. Nobody's gonna hold your hand. And no one's going to stand over you. Exactly how you get there is not important to me. And for our management, all the more so. The result. Full stop. You can for its reception at least all grouping of local free stalkers to a cancer - we are not interested. I need the data, the facts, and better yet, the specific people we are looking for. Dead or alive, it doesn't matter. Result. If I've been contacted on your behalf, you've got something. So let me know what you find out.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a3_suget_quest_3_svayznoy_dialog_4">
		<text>All right. I managed to locate one of the scientists from the missing group. He died in an anomaly. He had some documents on him. I think you might be interested in them. In addition, I've been able to trace the fate of at least two people from your group. One of them, probably a hired agent like myself, died under mysterious circumstances. According to the locals, eaten by unidentified mutants. Whether that's true or not is unknown. The other stalker was most likely a member of the missing group. He also died or was killed. Yeah, most likely killed. Either by locals or mercenaries on the locals' orders. Though I may have misidentified him - which one of the two was your agent and which one was a fighter. I don't know exactly. But the fact that they're both dead is a fact. If they're dead, they've been here for a while. The group hasn't left the territory under local control. I have a hunch it was wiped out entirely as well. Either the locals are hiding something about them... One thing they know about the scientists. It's a supposed area where they could still be hiding, if they're still alive.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a3_suget_quest_3_svayznoy_dialog_5">
		<text>I see. All in all, a satisfactory result so far. Fish and chips. You're right about our, shall we say, in-house agent working here. You make it sound like he's dead. That's what we were afraid of. He's really been out of touch for a long time. Last time he did, we got word that he was able to locate one of the missing group. The last link to that group ends with the death of this agent. It's likely they're all dead. So we'll go with that. And that's a result, albeit a very unfortunate one. The fact that you know a more specific area where you can continue the search for the scientists is encouraging. The fate of the scientists was of paramount importance to us. So here's what we're going to do. A few of our teams will be arriving here shortly. You, as far as I know, have quite successfully gained the trust of the local stalkers. Therefore, however you want, by hook or by crook, you must convince them not to interfere with our groups' activities here. After that, you will point out the search area to our teams. You got it? All right, I'll be in touch. We'll contact you when the teams are ready for the operation.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a3_suget_quest_3_svayznoy_dialog_6">
		<text>Copy that. Bye-bye.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Well, hello, savior. What do you need me for?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, don't you have any idea?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_2">
		<text>Probably to pay my debt. But I have nothing to give you at the moment. I haven't done much artifact hunting here, my main hiding place, where there's anything of value, is on Agroyantar...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_22">
		<text>I owe you and you've decided to collect now... I have no idea how I am going to repay it now because I have no money and no artifacts. Everything of value is in my hiding place on Agroyantar.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Think about what it is that I might need from you. Money, artifacts, that's fine, but I don't need it. But working for me, I think you can do that. You run a few errands for me, you'll consider yourself paid off.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_4">
		<text>What exactly do you want from me? And whose interests are going to be affected by it. You're not just any stalker, are you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_5">
		<text>Neither are you. Interests? Well, uh... I don't know. First of all, yours. Secondly, the Freedom grouping. And the third is up to you. Okay, that's enough lyrics. So, what I need from you. I've recently received information about a large bandit squad. Local stalkers somehow miraculously negotiated with them and bluntly let them into their territory. It is quite possible that these bandits are somehow connected with the mercenaries, and they, in turn, with the stalkers. The point is, these bandits are a real nuisance to me. That's all you need to know so far. And as you have already guessed - you need to eliminate them.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_6">
		<text>These bandits are most likely connected to Hassan, the local deputy. That's odd, because Harold promised to eliminate him. Oh, well. What's the size of their unit and where are they stationed?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_7">
		<text>What makes you think Hasan is the only one connected to the bandits? You're asking the right questions. That's very good. I like that approach. However, you're jumping to conclusions. Their squad is no more than ten guns. They should soon be positioned around a local abandoned farm. You have a few hours to prepare a good ambush. I'll give you the coordinates of the stash house - there's some equipment there. You gather a couple of land mines and meet your guests with dignity. You do that, we'll meet again and we'll talk about something else. I'm sure you'll have questions.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_8">
		<text>There's no way that questions won't arise? Also, I need to make some arrangements with the locals...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_88">
		<text>We don't need any more questions. We need to solve this problem so that they don't arise. Also, I need to make a deal with the locals...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_9">
		<text>About Clear Skies. Yeah, I'm aware of that. I assure you it won't take too long to work for me. Besides, I'm sure you'll reconsider some of your plans. As you can see, my answer raises more questions. Questions always arise, my friend. The important thing is whether or not it makes sense to ask them...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_10">
		<text>Do you think there won't be?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_11">
		<text>I don't think anything. What matters is what you think. All right, goodbye. Once you've done the job, you'll come at me again. Then we'll see if you make sense or if I have to point it out to you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_first_dialog_12">
		<text>All right.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_0">
		<text>What's that supposed to mean, you fucking cormorant? I'm a dead man now. I had a contract with those feathered stalkers. You son of a bitch just set me up...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Easy, easy. I told you there'd be questions. And the way I see it, you can't find the answers yourself...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_2">
		<text>What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, I'm grateful you saved my life, but now you're putting me in the noose yourself... Freedom decided to use me to stir up conflict with the Clear Skies group? For what? What am I supposed to do after all this? I was about to finish my work on the feathery ones before you sabotaged it.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Think, my friend. Your head was given to you for a reason, to wear a gas mask. And I'm not putting you in a noose. On the contrary, it's the second time I've pulled you out. But you don't realize it yet. Tell me, do you really think that your contract with the group "Clear Sky" will be generously paid? You think they need extra witnesses to their cause? You've been hired for this job and will be removed as soon as you complete it. The cleaners don't know it was you that took out their unit yet. But they will. But while we have time...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_4">
		<text>What? You think their contract is bogus? There hasn't been a single instance where anyone has ever questioned their credibility.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_5">
		<text>Yeah, you're right. No, there hasn't. Do you have any idea why they haven't? Isn't it because there was no one to tell? Stalker, I'm stomping around the Zone for a reason. And there's a reason why we do what we do. There's always a covert faction war going on. And you're in it up to your tonsils right now. So listen to what the wise men say if you don't want to get out of this game. It's win or die. There's no third option. So you decide what you want. </text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_6">
		<text>Why should I believe you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_66">
		<text>Give me one good reason why I should trust you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_7">
		<text>Uh, probably because you don't have a choice anymore. You took out a combat unit of one of the Zone's most powerful factions. Now it's up to me to solve this problem or not. It's no big deal, though. Well, think about it. "Clear Skies sends a free stalker to the middle of nowhere looking for some group of scientists of their own. You never wondered what that group of scientists was, why they were attacked and why exactly a squad of Pure Sky stalkers was sent after them? Or why an entire squad of lame-duck thugs are being sent after you now? By the way, I forgot to ask you - how did it go? Did the ambush work?</text>
  </string>	
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_8">
		<text>The ambush worked. The scientists were working for Clear Skies. They were attacked by mercenaries, a clan unit tried to rescue them, but to no avail. What, you don't like that theory?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_suget_quest_4_second_dialog_9">
		<text>You see, not everything in this life is that simple. To begin with, for one thing, those scholarly stalkers never worked for the Clear Sky faction. You have been deceived, my friend. Right from the start. I understand you're about to demand proof... Go to the abandoned tower. There's a stalker waiting for you. He's not my man, I'm warning you. And he doesn't need to know about me. But his information will corroborate anything I say. Tell him you were tracking a missing group of scientists on behalf of the Freedom faction. That stalker is quite a well-known figure in the Zone. You can't help but believe him. At least I hope not. And I hope you don't do anything stupid. You'd better hurry up. You don't have much time now. Once you understand the situation, I think you'll want to help me handle this in your own way.</text>

	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_4">
		<text>I'm looking for a missing group of stalker scientists commissioned by Freedom. They're new to the area. They got nabbed by some mercenaries or bandits and then came here...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_5">
		<text>What? So we're doing the same thing. Big surprise. How did you get to me now? Why don't you tell me everything you know?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_6">
		<text>An old friend told me where to find you. I don't know much. A squad of Clear Skies was sent after them, apparently to help. But apparently they died here. I haven't been able to find any trace of the scientists yet. What do you know about this case?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_7">
		<text>More than you do, stalker. But I don't want to tell you much about it. Though if you don't die, you'll still dig up most of the information. So listen. A group of scientists came out from Amber and they were supposed to meet us, I mean Shooter. We ordered some equipment for them to go to the centre of the Zone. We did not want to hand it over at the territory of Amber - too many strange people's ears and eyes there. They agreed to meet us on a neutral territory. But the scientists did not reach it. Someone got wind of the deal and tried to stop us. And that someone is the bastards at Clear Skies. They don't want anyone to go through the incinerator and will do anything to stop us. They were the ones who attacked the scientists, but something went wrong there. Most of the group died, but the people who had the equipment - they managed to get away. The feathered ones themselves are not very good fighters, and they did not use the services of mercenaries. On their trail was sent a squad of purebreds with the clear objective - to find and destroy the remnants of the group of scientists and equipment that was with them, at any cost...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_8">
		<text>Wow, what a twist. On the contrary, I was informed that the scientists were working for Sky's Deep Space and that a squad of them had been sent to help them...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_9">
		<text>Huh, that's all lies. Trust me on this one. The Pure Sky scientists are the ones responsible for this whole mess. They'd plough all over Topeka to find those scientists' equipment. But it's out of their reach. I've just taken it from them and put it in a safe place. So Clear Skies is left with nothing. I'm sorry we couldn't get the scientists out of here. The birds will kill them when they find them. But, we must make these sacrifices for the common cause and the stalker good. Though maybe friends from Liberty or Dutya will get to them sooner.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_10">
		<text>And you're not afraid to tell me all this?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_1010">
		<text>I don't know why you're telling me all this.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_11">
		<text>Why should I be afraid? The fate of the scientists no longer interests me. They've done their job - they've handed over the equipment for the expedition. And the birds won't get their hands on the equipment, no matter what. Even if you are their spy. It is profitable to me to have you as their spy-you will not kill me, but if you pass the information I have told you, it will give the scientists a chance to be saved. Besides, it's not like I haven't lied to you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_12">
		<text>Damn, this is complicated. What an asshole I've gotten myself into... At least I lied to you, Fang. I did work, in fact, while I was still working for Clear Skies. They hired me to find a group of scientific stalkers and their missing unit. And recently I was approached by people from Freedom. They hinted that the Pure Sky people were only using me and would kill me as soon as I did my job. I did not believe them at first, but now you have fully confirmed their words. Besides, the freedom fighters arranged for me to kill some purebreds with whom I was supposed to work next. So I'm caught in the millstone, in a veritable web of lies from which there is no way out.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_13">
		<text>Yeah, stalker. Interesting story... You're in a sad situation, shall we say. You can't go back to the birds - they'll know you killed them and you're a dead man. The Svoboda people basically set you up... I don't know, I wouldn't trust them after that. Well, you lied to me at first, too. Boy, this is a game. And it's a dangerous game, and you either live or you die. There's no third option.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_14">
		<text>I've heard that before...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_1414">
		<text>That sounds familiar.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_15">
		<text>By the way, it turns out that you and I ended up here, and know each other in absentia even earlier. A stalker like Vazgen, remember? You took a bag of documents from him to the hiding place. Well, I'm the one who took it and smuggled it further up the chain to the bandits. By doing so, we caused a lot of trouble for the purebreds. Soon dozens of renegades of all stripes will descend on the moors. This will probably help us with the Rifleman and distract them until we can make final preparations for the march. And this plan was suggested to me by one of the freedom scouts. And here's my advice to you - try to jump or run away to Duty. Not the best option, but at least they do not surrender. If they will offer you good terms of cooperation - why not? They didn't kill you, though they could have. For me the main thing is that you were not on the side of the feathery scum. That's all that matters to you now. So it's up to you what to do. We can't take you with us. We've got our own way.</text>

	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_16">
		<text>A free man saved my life. It might even be the same man, the one you worked with. I think I'll try to get out of here first. And if that doesn't work out, then we'll see.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_17">
		<text>All the more reason. If you can't get out, go to Liberty without a second thought. Okay, bye. And, yeah, forget we talked.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_stalker_fang_dialog_18">
		<text>All right. Good luck with your group. Maybe you're the ones who will change the history of the Zone forever.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_0">
		<text>I don't even know where to start. Fang has completely turned my whole world upside down.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_1">
		<text>So upside down that you tried to escape?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_2">
		<text>But you didn't run away...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_22">
		<text>But I'm here in the end...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_3">
		<text>That's right. The veil of lies that has fallen from your eyes hasn't prevented you from continuing to think soberly. If you'd ignored my message, you'd be dead.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_4">
		<text>I understand that. Well, now that we're here, you still need me for something and you're not going to kill me yet. What am I supposed to do now, in light of recent events? I understand our main concern right now is the Clear Skies group?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_5">
		<text>That's correct. "Clear Skies is a big problem. And we have a problem to solve. Officially, I represent the Freedom Group. Not officially, you'll know when the time comes. Or you won't. That's not important right now. What's important is that you'll be working for me now. You've done well here - you're smart and you can make things happen in the faction game. I've been watching you for a long time - and you may have been watching my actions, although you didn't know that I was the one involved in these events. So, what we have to do now. First, eliminate those purebreds who were sent here on the spoils of those scientific stalkers. You've already wiped out one group, but there's still both the informers and one major combat unit left. Secondly - we need to take care of the scientists themselves.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_6">
		<text>What exactly are you suggesting about the scientists?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_66">
		<text>What's the best way to deal with the scientists?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_7">
		<text>There are two options here. Either we remove them, or we continue to use them in our party against Clear Skies. Most likely, we have to take them out. Getting them out of here is going to be a problem. They've done their primary task of handing over equipment to the Strelok group.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_8">
		<text>Your organisation supports the Strelok group?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_88">
		<text>Why does your organisation support Strelok?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_888">
		<text>How do you benefit from supporting Strelok and its stalkers?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_9">
		<text>Let's just say our organisation has benefited from Strelok and his guys so far. They're trying to infiltrate the centre of the Zone, where no normal man has set foot for a long time. No problem. Let them try. At least as long as they're a bone in the throat of Clear Skies, we'll play along.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_10">
		<text>You said you've been watching me for a long time. And that you've been involved in a lot of things that have happened here...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_11">
		<text>That's right. I was the missing freedom scout you tried to track down as soon as you arrived. At the same time, I was Duty's informant. That's how I got rid of the extra party members. Not forever of course, but for a while. Again, you were my hands that time. Though I didn't realise it. I also faked the breakdown of one of the free stalker radio stations, hinted that Hasan would begin cooperating with the mercenaries, and incited Vazgen to prepare some major dirt on Mineshadow. A lot of things, my friend. A major chess game has begun to play out here that will likely lead to a major war between the clans. As unfortunate as it sounds, we need this war. And you have an important role to play in it, if you continue to work as you are now.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_12">
		<text>Why did you set the renegades on the Moor? I don't think it was just to make trouble for Clear Sky.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_13">
		<text>That's right. I had much more far-reaching plans for this. Well, we'll talk about that later. Right now, you're gonna have to finish things up here. Go to the designated area first. That's where you'll kill the Clear Skies agent. You've already met him here. Then proceed to the stalker base. Find their radio operator there and tell him it's time for Operation Vengeance. He'll understand. That's the signal for him to contact the feathered squad. Afterwards, you eliminate them. And lastly... The group of scientists left alive is too large. Six men. I'll take three of them and bring them out - I'll tell you what for. You will go to their hideout and kill the others. You got it?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_1_dialog_14">
		<text>Yes. I'm on my way.</text>

	<string id="topi_b1_radist_quest_final_dialog_0">
		<text>Valar Morghulis... Have you forgotten me already?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_radist_quest_final_dialog_1">
		<text>Likewise. I thought you'd decided to leave these lands. And you did.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_radist_quest_final_dialog_2">
		<text>So did I, but circumstances were different... I have something for you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_radist_quest_final_dialog_22">
		<text>Circumstances, my friend. You know they're not always on our side. By the way, I have something for you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_radist_quest_final_dialog_3">
		<text>What is it?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_radist_quest_final_dialog_4">
		<text>A mutual friend asked me to tell you that it's time for Operation Vengeance. You know what I mean?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_radist_quest_final_dialog_5">
		<text>Quite... When you see our mutual friend, tell him it's been executed to the best of your ability.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b1_radist_quest_final_dialog_6">
		<text>All right, then. Goodbye.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_0">
		<text>It's done. The Pistonebs who came here have all been eliminated. Their liaison, the fighting squad, all of them. The scientists you didn't take out have been dealt with successfully as well.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, that's great. This batch is over so far in our favour. The feathered ones got a kick in the teeth, the Strelok group is ready to head to the centre for the Incinerator. Duty and Freedom have each lost one of their units and this has allowed them to be excluded from the spread for now. But only for now. Local stalkers - we've prevented the breakup of the faction and that's good too. So, what else? Now we need to play the next game, with much higher stakes.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_2">
		<text>So you're not a freedom fighter after all? You want to tell me who you really are?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_22">
		<text>You're obviously not a libertine, are you? Will you stop playing riddles and tell me who you work for?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_3">
		<text>Eh, my friend, I wouldn't advise you to say that question again. Let's just say I'm someone who cares about what's going on in the world...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_4">
		<text>All right. Have it your way. You saved my life. And I'm grateful for that. What happened to those scientists you brought out of these places?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_5">
		<text>They will be properly taken care of. A mercenary has kindly agreed to escort them to safety. By the way, I'll tell you a little about my plans.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_6">
		<text>I'm listening...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_66">
		<text>Listening to you...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_7">
		<text>The mercenary who led the remaining scholars is not an ordinary man. You and he have something in common. His name is Scar. You may have heard that name before. He does not yet know, as you do, how and why he will be used in the coming game. But one day he will play a key role. The important thing now is that he gets to the Fens as quickly as possible.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_8">
		<text>What's he got to do there on those moors, plus with the scientists that the purebreds will simply wipe out?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_9">
		<text>Who's to say the feathered ones will know whether they're scientists or not? Forget the scientists altogether. Forget those, too. They're going to die anyway. Once Scar reaches the swamps, there will be a violent and sudden blowout. No one will survive but him. Don't look so surprised. You remember the psi-wave-wounded scout in the village. That was my job, too. Scar will go to Clear Skies. He'll be recruited just as you were once. Lebedev's goal will be the same - to prevent the Strelka from reaching Pripyat and Chernobyl. And Scar will do their bidding. Surely they'll start by charging him to clear the swamps from the renegades, who've come at your mercy, and then we'll see... The important thing is, he'll be one of them.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_10">
		<text>And then what? He'll start working for the birds, follow the trail of Strelok and his group. What's in it for us?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_11">
		<text>Our gain is that we'll know both the plans of the Clear Skies and Strelok's group. Remember, our goal in the next game is to take out Clear Skies entirely. We'll get Scar to eventually lure them out of their lair and destroy them. We'll kill some of them, maybe spare some and make them work for us. It doesn't matter. What matters is that their grouping must cease to exist. And that's just one part of the plan.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_12">
		<text>Well, what's my role?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_1212">
		<text>And what is my role?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_13">
		<text>It's simple, my friend. You and I are going to start a war... Well, how do you say war, we'll just push the factions into action. Some new territories will open up, clans will go there for new artifacts. Their patrons will start trying to negotiate amongst themselves, dividing up new spheres of influence. And we'll just add a little spice to the action... We'll start with Duty and Liberty. They will be the easiest to deal with. Especially since you've already made your first steps here...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_1_suget_quest_final_2_dialog_14">
		<text>Good. You've shown me another way that a deceived man can go. You can count on me, I won't stray from it. However, I didn't say you'd walk beside me...</text>

	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_1_anubis_dialog_3">

		<text>What you heard. You're going to break your contract with the feathered stalker group before it's too late. You don't know the whole truth, my friend. I will reveal it to you, and you will have to believe it. Your life will depend on it.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_1_anubis_dialog_6">

		<text>"Clear Skies hired you to find the missing group of scientists and their search party. But you've never wondered who exactly attacked those scientists, or why a squad of Clear Skies was sent on their trail. I'll tell you who. The purebreds themselves. And that alleged search party isn't really a search party, it's a punishment party. Which was supposed to get on the trail of the surviving scientists and destroy them. You've been tricked, Varg. Now you find the scientists, report them to the purebreds and you will simply be killed along with them.</text>
  </string>

	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_1_svayznoy_dialog_4">
		<text>I've managed to find out that the scientists did come into local stalker-controlled territory. Your team followed. But most likely lost their lives. There's been some evidence to suggest that they did. The bodies of the dead cleaner men have been recovered. Now, about the scientists. The approximate area of their location has been determined. So we can go directly there.</text>

		<text>What did I say? But you didn't want to hear it. But that's OK, you're alive and in a position to make things right. Your main mistake isn't even that you trusted the birds, it's that you decided to interfere in the internal conflict of the local stalker group and took the wrong side. Hasan is a vile creature. You found out who he was, knew what he did. And decided to support him anyway. He told Clear Sky everything you should have told him. This made your services no longer relevant and you were decided to be eliminated immediately, even before the scientists were found. However, Hasan did not give specific orders for your elimination. So your fate was affected indirectly. What cannot be said for the fate of the group. He'll soon kill Harold, if he hasn't already, and he'll use the full extent of his power. So we'll have to deal with that as well, but later.</text>

	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_anubis_dialog_5">
		<text>Officially, I work for Liberty. That's enough for you to know for now. But unofficially, I work for a much more powerful organization. Consider yourself working for it now. I wouldn't advise against it. You don't have a choice anyway. To Clear Skies you're the enemy, to Freedom you'll be the enemy, just as you were to Dutya. Remember your arrival here. I was the very Liberty scout who led the scouting party and whom you were trying to find. Beyond that, however, I was also Dutya's informant. I was the one who set up their attack on the freedom fighters. Well, you've already killed the Debtors. I have no trouble getting that information to the right ears and in the right way for me. So it's your choice. But I'm not trying to scare you, I'm trying to get another experienced ally into our ranks. You've done a great job leading this investigation. I've been around quite a few times and watched your progress in this game. The dead body of a purebred mercenary, the psi-strike wounded Scout, the broken radostation. Heh, that's not all the things I've had a hand in. So...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_anubis_dialog_6">
		<text>I've already made my choice. I'm with you. So, why would the feathered ones want to kill scientists, anyway?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_anubis_dialog_7">
		<text>Let me get this straight. You've heard of stalkers like Shooter, Fang, Ghost? They're already living legends of the Zone. And they can get even bigger. Especially when they implement their plan and sneak through the Burner to the other side of the barrier, to Pripyat and ChAES. Those scientists were supposed to give them some equipment. However, Strelok's trek, in addition to well-wishers, had also spawned foes. "Clear Skies is one of them. And one might even say some of the most mainstream. They do not want anyone to sneak into the centre of the Zone. That's why they attacked the scientists, so that they wouldn't hand over the necessary equipment to Shooter. But something went wrong and they failed to kill them all at once. Some of the eggheads escaped here. They sent punishers on the trail, but they all died. That's the whole story.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_anubis_dialog_8">
		<text>No one's been able to get through the Burning Man.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_anubis_dialog_88">
		<text>But it's impossible. No one's ever come through the Burner.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_anubis_dialog_9">
		<text>Just because no one's gotten through doesn't mean it's impossible. It's to our organization's advantage that the Rifleman and his companions get through. Besides, they're a bone in our enemies' throats. And the enemy of our enemies is our friend. All right, enough with the lyrics. We'll talk more later and I'll answer the questions that interest you the most. In the meantime, let's get down to business. Here's what we're gonna do. I know the resting place of the feathered detachment they have sent to eliminate the scientists. Attacking them ourselves now would be foolish and not graceful. We won't do anything foolish this time. Several mercenaries have died here recently. I think you can guess who killed them. Now, you go to the base and you find Hasan there. Tell him the syndicate men he was working with were killed by the purebreds. Say they found out that one of their fighters was killed before by the mercenaries and disguised as one of their own, trying to trick someone there. You'll find something to say, I think. The main thing is to get Hassan to send the mercenaries to the village. And from there, they'll do it themselves. The blues will be at the feathers' throats for our enjoyment. You'll show up when it's all over and kill the survivors. In the meantime, I'll figure out how to cover our tracks at the base and figure out what to do with the scientists.</text>

	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_anubis_dialog_10">
		<text>What's wrong with the faction base?</text>

		<text>The fact that Hasan's gonna be running the place now. That's what's wrong. Besides, you're getting too much exposure there - not good for what's coming up. We'll have to get rid of them.</text>

		<text>Valar Morghulis. What, you thought you'd never see me again? You were hoping I'd get killed by purebreds?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_zam_dialog_1">
		<text>You don't say. You're not so easy to kill, stalker. And I see the birds aren't your friends anymore. Well, that's surprising. Why are you here?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_zam_dialog_2">
		<text>But I don't think they're gonna be your friends, either. Something's come to my attention. You'll find it interesting. Two men who did business with you died recently. Don't ask me how I know, that's all. Well, here's the thing. I know it was the purebreds who killed them. Avenged that poor man who got torn up by the blues and passed off as one of their own. The squad that did it stopped at the village today...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_zam_dialog_3">
		<text>Huh. And you expect me to believe that? Decide to take on your former friends with my hands? No way, no stalker...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_zam_dialog_4">
		<text>Tell me, what would your accomplices do if they found out that you knew the reasons why their people died, but you did nothing about it? Probably they will get very upset and question all the agreements they have made. After all, doing business with a man who keeps important information a secret from them is a shame, eh? Uh, that's not good, Hasan.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_zam_dialog_5">
		<text>I see what you're getting at. All right, I'll inform my hired friends that the purebreds have taken the village. They'll destroy them. This is the second time you've tried to make a fool out of me. Careful, stalker, my patience is not infinite. Soon Harold will be gone and no one will save you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_var_2_suget_quest_2_zam_dialog_6">
		<text>Don't worry. That was the last time. I'm sure of it. Goodbye.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_0">
		<text>It was done exactly as you commanded. The mercenaries and the purebreds have been killed. Stalker base destroyed, local clan fallen. The scientists who remained in the bunker are also dead. Now tell me everything - what was all this madness for?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, what was it for. For our mutual benefit. "Clear Skies tricked you and used you for their own purposes. But they never came to fruition. But ours has come to fruition. So here we are. While you were dealing with the purebots, I took out some scientists and handed them over to a mercenary. By the way, the original attack on the stalker base was also my doing. All you had to do was clean up the mess. But back to the mercenary. His name is Scar. He's taking three scientists to the marshes, to the base of Clear Skies. It's an order to get people through Agroyantar. On the way, those we don't need anymore will die. And the mercenary will go to the birds and play the role of a Trojan horse.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_2">
		<text>I see. You want to infiltrate your man to undermine the group internally, but wouldn't sending renegades to the marshes do it better?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_3">
		<text>Luring the Renegades out of their lair was a wise move, with far-reaching consequences. They would certainly weaken the feathered ones for a while, but not wipe them out entirely. It is foolish to bet on mere thieves and brigands in such a matter. They're just expendable. They'll work their way through and then they're off the stage. Scar will probably be assigned to deal with the renegades first, then follow the Strelok group. Clear Skies needs to stop Strelok, and we need to stop Clear Skies. So we take advantage of their mutual weaknesses.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_4">
		<text>What's my role going to be?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_44">
		<text>What do I have to do?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_5">
		<text>You're coming with me. Before Scar gets to the Swamp, we'll need to push the factions into a more overt war than what's going on now. You've shown yourself to be a skilled agent and will have no problem infiltrating the ranks of Dutya or Liberty. So unleashing a conflict won't be difficult.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_6">

  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_66">
		<text>What's it for?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_7">
		<text>The zone needs a good shake-up. That's one. Second, a lot of clans have built up a decent amount of power and influence. Not all of them are working for the good of our organization one way or another. They need to be weakened.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_8">
		<text>There's something you're not telling me...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_9">
		<text>Of course there is. But for now, you don't have to worry about that. I've already given you quite a bit of detail about our plan. Don't worry too much about the other clans. We'll get them at each other's throats and then it'll be business as usual. The main task of the future party is to eliminate Clear Skies. Completely. </text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_anubis_var_2_suget_quest_final_dialog_10">
		<text>I get it... You can count on me. I think we should get out of this place.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_0">
		<text>Don't you get tired of standing around here all day?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_1">
		<text>Heh, my friend, everyone in the clan has a job to do. Mine is to stand and guard the base from uninvited guests like you... If you don't have anything in particular, you'd better get out of my way and stay out of my way.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_2">
		<text>Take it easy. I'm not from around here. I don't know much about your laws. I just got here a while ago. What can you tell me about this place anyway?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_3">
		<text>Stalker laws, my friend, they're the same everywhere. You don't look like a rookie. You don't have to be a rookie either. I've got a good eye for who's who. You didn't just come here for the artifact money like the other bounty hunters. That's why I want to warn you right off the bat, don't cause trouble here. If it's your fault, you won't live long.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_4">
		<text>I've heard that before. My friend, don't just threaten people. They haven't been rude to you, they haven't done you any harm. You don't want to talk, don't talk. Although, you could tell something interesting to a tired traveler. Surely there had been some rumors going around lately. Maybe something interesting happened.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_5">
		<text>Have I ever threatened you? You call me friend again, I'll cut your throat. Now that's a threat. You know the difference?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_6">
		<text>More than that.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_66">
		<text>I think I do.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_7">
		<text>Well, that's good. I'm glad we understand each other. It's pretty rare for people who understand. There were two recently. From Duty and from Liberty. And then their faction units were found here nearby... What's left of them, to be exact. And who talked them into it, nobody knows. That's why the guards are all worked up right now. You better get going and don't ask too many questions.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_8">
		<text>Have you heard anything else of interest, other than news of another Liberty-Duty skirmish?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_9">
		<text>You're so meticulous. All right, I'll tell you a story the Militaria walkers were talking about. They say a scientist's corpse has been found somewhere in the local woods. No one knows how he got there. But the fact remains. From the corpse stalkers took a good protective suit. And went to local anomalies they were afraid to go near before. And one of them found a hefty artifact, which is almost half a mile. Then what happened - no one knows, but those stalkers, who found the artifact, vanished into thin air. Apparently, someone silenced them forever. No more information about the artifact, of course. The hiding place, where those stalkers could have hidden it before disappearing, was never found. Running and rummaging through the woods - you know, there aren't any particular enthusiasts here. And it's most likely an empty undertaking. The artifact must have been in the possession of one of the powers that be for a long time.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_bes_dialog_10">
		<text>Yeah, definitely an enlightening conversation. It's pure nonsense, except for one thing. A dead scientist... Okay, don't be mad-- I'm leaving. Good luck.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_0">
		<text>Pozdarov. What are you doing sitting here, not doing your job? I'm Varg, by the way, I'm new here.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_1">
		<text>Call me Czech. Just Ches. I just got off duty, so I'm taking a break. And I've got a job to do that's different from just a carul.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_2">
		<text>I see. How long have you been here? And who exactly in the clan do the patrolmen report to? Cause I'm wondering if I should join you.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_3">
		<text>I've only been here a couple of weeks myself. Came in on business, so to speak, but I got hung up. Needed a job that wasn't too dusty. Harold personally recruits the men to guard the base, so you can't just get in here. Unless it's through someone. Or for something... You're asking a lot of questions, Varg, thus attracting unnecessary attention. Unprofessional, colleague.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_4">
		<text>Colleague? How did you know that...</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_5">
		<text>Relax. It's all agents and other people's people around here. We're all connected and in the same ballpark, so you don't have to be afraid to be more direct with me than you originally wanted to be. As I understand, our acquaintance you would reduce to inquiries about destiny of the lost group of purebreds and scientists stalkers on whose trail they followed? Well - locals know something about it. And they even have some leads on your clients. But they won't lift a finger unless they have something to gain from it. You want to do what you want, get them to do it, and they'll bring it to you on a silver platter. But you have to be careful. Not only your employers and local people are watching you, but also some other clans. You should be wary of them. I can give you some more information, but for a favor. A service of choice. I need help placing special equipment. You can help me set up a jamming generator or a radar jammer. So, would you be willing to work more closely with me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_6">
		<text>And for the love of your fellow man, what's in it for you? I got nothing to lose, though. Let me help you with the jammer. But I need details. And how do I know you're not one of them? </text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_7">
		<text>You don't. Believe it if you want it, don't believe it if you don't want it. It's simple. But take my advice, don't be so blind about trusting the representatives of some groups you might come across. Their motives and thoughts may not always be disinterested. Particularly some people from Freedom. On the jamming generator, it's simple. I need to make it possible for some people or agents to hold confidential meetings on farmland. The place needs to be secured against possible wiretapping by locals. The device itself is disguised as a plain old box. You move out, lay it down and come back in.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_8">
		<text>Well, now I get it. You work for Duty?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_888">
		<text>So you work for Duty?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_9">
		<text>No, I don't. And you won't know who I work for until I want to. In the meantime, I just want to keep you from falling prey to a very sophisticated spider. And right now he's here under the guise of a freedom fighter.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_10">
		<text>Even if he is, it doesn't make me feel bad. My business is Clear Skies. I don't care about the rest. Although no - now I do care about you, specifically the information you're willing to share.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_11">
		<text>Suit yourself. But be warned, it might be too late.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_12">
		<text>I'll keep that in mind...</text>
  </string>	
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_66">
		<text>And how do I know you're not one of them? I guess I got nothing to lose, though. Let me help you with the blocker and then we'll see. But I need details.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_77">
		<text>Out of nowhere. Believe it if you want it, don't believe it if you don't want it. It's simple. But take my advice, don't be so blind about trusting the representatives of some groups that you might meet on your way. Their motives and thoughts may not always be disinterested. Particularly some people from Freedom. With the blocker, it's simple. I have information that someone may sabotage the locals during clan negotiations. The place needs to be secured against the possibility of radio-controlled charges being detonated. The device itself is disguised as a simple wooden box. You move out to the village, plant it in the attic and come back.</text>

	<string id="topi_p1_patrol_ceh_dialog_1010">

	<string id="topi_c7_ceh_quest_1_second_dialog_0">
		<text>I've completed your mission. The jamming device is installed. However, right after that, I was attacked by a group of mercenaries. I got the blues down and that's what's stressing me out. I don't really feel like signing up as an enemy of the syndicate. Who am I helping now, after all? Who are you, Czech?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_c7_ceh_quest_1_second_dialog_1">
		<text>But you did help. Not even knowing who you helped. One thing I can assure you of is that it won't hurt anyone. Just think of it as doing a good thing, keeping good people out of trouble. You say you were attacked by mercenaries? If you killed them, then there's no sign of them - you don't have to worry about them. I'll take care of that, my friend.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_c7_ceh_quest_1_second_dialog_2">
		<text>So be it, but let's get back to the cost of this good deed. Oh, and your calmness surprises me, too. You don't consider the syndicate a serious problem?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_c7_ceh_quest_1_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Well you didn't consider Duty a serious problem by killing a quad of their scouts, did you? That's it, forget the mercenaries. Now, as for your payment. What have you heard about the Sin faction?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_c7_ceh_quest_1_second_dialog_4">
		<text>Nothing much. Clan of crazy fanatics hiding out in the Dark Vale area. Kind of like a rattling mix of gangsters and the Monolith. What's that got to do with anything?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_c7_ceh_quest_1_second_dialog_5">
		<text>It does, my friend. Your information about this clan is long out of date. The Sin clan everyone knew has ceased to exist. Most of its followers have been wiped out, but the survivors have been taken under the tutelage of very powerful people. The group had been reorganised, and first-class specialists from the mainland had joined its ranks. Specialists in reconnaissance and sabotage. Now Sin is no longer a clan of fanatics, but a group of first class agents working undercover throughout the Exclusion Zone. They are clever, cunning, ruthless and deadly. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some of them may possess outstanding psi powers. They have no base, they have no identifying marks of any kind. They can be amongst all, whether amongst the Debtors, the Freedmen or the Freedmen. They are an organisation with powerful masters, serious funding channels and ever-growing influence. They conduct covert operations, pit clans against each other, intercept large shipments of artefacts, cut off arms and equipment channels. These are the pros of such affairs. Not many people know about them, and those who do try to keep their mouths shut. And for all I know, one of those agents may be here right now with an unknown purpose. He's working under the guise of a Svoboda or a Dolgov agent. Emissaries sinners quite often conduct the recruitment of the most experienced stalkers, as well as agents of other groups in their ranks, and do it just masterfully.</text>

	<string id="topi_c7_ceh_quest_1_second_dialog_6">
		<text>Now that's a hell of a story. It's useful knowledge, of course, but no more than that. It is unlikely to coincide with my interests and is of no use to me. </text>

You don't know how far your investigation will take you or who will get in your way. But if you do, you know you can count on me. By the way, don't say no to the local radio operator and the hunter.

		<text>Here's the deal. We've got some uninvited nocturnal creatures. And they're extremely dangerous and extremely deadly. Several groups of harvesters have died after encountering them. For a while, we didn't know what they could be. However, one of our hunters managed to track the creatures at night and relayed to the base that they were chimeras. Afterwards he was devoured and all we could hear on the radio was his screams. Anyway, something's got to be done about them right now. You know, we're short on hunters right now, so I'd be happy if you could help. You've proven yourself capable of taking this case.</text>

  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_first_dialog_2">
		<text>All right, I'll do it. But I'll have to be prepared. Chimeras are not to be trifled with. I took one down on Amber once. Luck is much more important than skill.</text>
  </string> 
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_first_dialog_3">
		<text>You don't have much time to prepare. Get a bigger gun and more grenades. My man's waiting for you. He says he's tracked down a creature near the farm. So get over there as soon as you can.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_first_dialog_4">
		<text>So I'll have a partner?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_first_dialog_44">
		<text>Your man? What's that supposed to mean?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_first_dialog_5">
		<text>You'll be working with a partner. And that's out of the question. Yakut is an experienced hunter. Together, you two have a chance of taking her down and surviving. Or isn't the example of the one they've already devoured enough for you? That's it. This conversation is over. Let's get moving. The last thing we need is for this hunter to get eaten while you're busy.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_first_dialog_6">
		<text>All right, I got it. We'll do our best.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_first_dialog_0">
		<text>I'm from Zmeelow. So we have to work together?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_first_dialog_1">
		<text>It looks that way. Couldn't that dumb bastard have found someone better than you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_first_dialog_2">
		<text>Then he couldn't. What do we do now? Were you able to track this thing down?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_first_dialog_3">
		<text>One already tried tracking it. I don't want to follow it to the afterlife just yet. So I've just been watching from the sidelines. I'm not happy with the results. There are two chimeras. One of them's a bogeyman. It's likely our colleague managed to shoot it before he died. But that's not certain. The other isn't quite a full-grown specimen yet.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_first_dialog_4">
		<text>But either way, there's two of them. And that makes it difficult. What do we do in that case?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_first_dialog_44">
		<text>There's still two of them. And that's a big fucking problem. What do we do with that?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_first_dialog_5">
		<text>Let's start by taking the farm itself. I got a chimera in the woods right behind it. We'll figure it out from there.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_first_dialog_6">
		<text>All right.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_second_dialog_0">
		<text>We're here. What's next?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_second_dialog_1">
		<text>We got to split up. You take care of the dead guy, and I'll take care of the other one. I agree it's not a good plan, but we don't have a choice now.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_second_dialog_2">
		<text>Are you sure there were only two?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_second_dialog_22">
		<text>I hope you were pretty sure there were only two.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Yes, I was. Don't worry about those things. If you've ever dealt with them, you can handle them. There's something else that's bothering me right now.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_second_dialog_4">
		<text>What's that? Don't fucking pull that on me. Did you find out anything else while you were watching the chimeras?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_second_dialog_5">
		<text>I don't think that's any of your business. Your business is chimeras. I saw some strange man in a hoodie. And for some reason, it didn't look human to me. Didn't look like a controller, though. All right, forget it. Solve the problem with your chimera, then come back here. You got it?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_hunter_quest_himera_second_dialog_6">
		<text>Yeah, I got it. Good luck with that.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_0">
		<text>Snake, I killed the chimera. But there are complications.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_1">
		<text>What? What kind of complications? You couldn't take out these nocturnal predators? Where's Yakut?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_2">
		<text>He disappeared. And how do you know there's more than one chimera?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_3">
		<text>This is where I ask the questions. What do you mean, disappeared? Are you out of your fucking mind? All the more or less normal hunters have died in the last two days. And you're just standing there, trying to get your head around it? Come on, what the hell happened?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_4">
		<text>Yakut found out there were two chimeras. One of them was a stray. He suggested we split up. I was to finish off the litter, Yakut would take the healthy one. I dealt with my creature, went back to where we'd agreed. Yakut wasn't there. There was no sound of shooting or fighting or anything like that either. Neither was there any sign of the second chimera. Whether there was one at all was Yakut's guess, nothing more. I didn't take the risk of searching the place alone at night and returned to base. Yakut was gone and that was a fact. Whether he's alive or not, I won't tell you. But I've done my job. The chimera is dead.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_5">
		<text>If the chimera's dead, that's good. Consider your job done. But the possible death or disappearance of Yakut makes me think and sad. The clan is losing experienced hunters. And we can't make up for our losses. We'll have to fall at the feet of our superiors and beg them to shift some of their duties to the scouts. But that's not even the worst of it. What scares me is the unknown. Yakut couldn't have died so easily from some stinking chimera. Even if it was there - which I now doubt - he would have been able to deal with it. So it must have been something else. Did you notice anything else suspicious?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_6">
		<text>Yakut was talking about some man in a hoodie he had seen in that area, but he didn't look like a controller.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_66">
		<text>Yakut said some man in a hoodie. And he wasn't a controller.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_7">
		<text>A man in a hoodie, you say? There's a cemetery nearby. A nasty cemetery. The creepy stuff's been crawling out of those graves. Chimeras are the flowers of life by comparison. But that's one theory. All right, Varg. You've done your job, now let the others do theirs. I'll have the scouts sweep the area. Take care.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a5_zmeelov_quest_himera_second_dialog_8">
		<text>Bye.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Well, hello. Your management says you're trustworthy after all, and I might even ask you for extra work. Is that right?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_1">
		<text>Yes, it's true. Look, Varg. I know this is going to sound really stupid, but realistically, trust me - I had nothing to do with the attack on you. I don't know how they knew you'd be in the area.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_2">
		<text>All right, forget it. Forget the whole assault thing. If your superiors are vouching for you, then so be it. Let's hear what kind of job you got for me.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_3">
		<text>You ever heard of artifact selection? If not, briefly, it's changing their properties from negative to positive. Or even further enhancing the properties they already have. Now to the point. I have some samples of artefacts, and it's up to you to select them near the anomalous field. It's not a difficult task, but it's risky. There's a good chance of getting fried in an anomaly. So, you up for it?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_44">
		<text>I don't think so. I'm gonna pass on this mission. I don't want to go back to the anomalies.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_4">
		<text>All right, I'll do it. Now let's be more specific. Which anomalous field will I have to go into?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_5">
		<text>During your previous assignment, you collected anomaly scanners. When we analysed their results, we came to some rather important conclusions. Surely you must have remembered the malachite spherical formations in the forest. Didn't you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_6">
		<text>Yes, I remember those anomalies.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_66">
		<text>Of course I remember. It's the first time I've seen such things around here.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_7">
		<text>That's good. Well, here goes. These anomalies had a very strange anomalous field and the most surprising thing is that these are the kind of fields that are best suited for selection. I would also like to say that each of these three anomalies has its own individual field, different from the other. So here's what we're going to do. Here are three artifact samples and special equipment. You go to each of the three anomalies and conduct a selection on one of the artifacts in its field. Once you've done that, you go back. Is that clear?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_first_dialog_8">
		<text>Got it. All done.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_second_dialog_0">
		<text>So it's done. Selection on all three artifact samples has been done.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Good. (chuckles) Well done for pulling it off. Give me the resulting artifact samples and our equipment.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_second_dialog_2">
		<text>There you go. What, you didn't think I could do it?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Basically, no. I doubted how dangerous the anomalies could be while you were in their field of action. These malachite formations are still poorly understood.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_second_dialog_4">
		<text>So I was also a guinea pig?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_second_dialog_44">
		<text>You used me as a test subject?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_second_dialog_5">
		<text>I didn't say that. You came to those conclusions on your own. Call it what you want, but either way, you did your job. Now we examine the resulting artefacts, and if the selection samples have a better set of properties, I'm afraid to imagine how much their value will increase. As will the possible fee for access to the anomalous fields. But that, my friend, is another story. You've had your share. So long.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b41_artefacter_quest_seleczia_second_dialog_6">
		<text>All right, then. Goodbye.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Pozdarov. Why do you need me? What's so important?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_1">
		<text>Remember when you helped me set up Credo's radars? Well, one of them picked up something unusual. We sent a team of scouts out there. They went to the area and stopped communicating.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_22">
		<text>Oh, no, my friend. You'll excuse me, but I'm not going to run around and find out exactly what happened to your scouts. You figure it out on your own. It's bad enough I helped you set up those radar systems.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_2">
		<text>What exactly did the radar pick up?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_3">
		<text>The hell it did. Something pretty big. But it doesn't look like a mutant. It's too static. It's probably some kind of new anomaly. I could be wrong, though. The fine-tuning of the correctness of these radars is still ongoing. I've changed a lot of things around here since you worked with them last time.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_4">
		<text>Let's skip the technical details this time, okay? Where exactly did this happen?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_44">
		<text>Let's be specific. Where exactly did it happen?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_5">
		<text>Just outside the village. So the team got there pretty quickly. And communication with them was lost immediately.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_6">
		<text>So maybe there's some sort of strong anomalous field blocking their radios?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_7">
		<text>An anomalous field - don't be ridiculous. Otherwise the radars couldn't pick up anything. Right now they're clearly picking up a large object and several people still alive near it. Their radios are on and working. But they're not responding. Find out what the hell it is. Just be careful.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_first_dialog_8">
		<text>All right, I'll check it out.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a45_medic_quest_angel_first_dialog_0">
		<text>What? What's wrong? How the fuck did I get here?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_medic_quest_angel_first_dialog_1">
		<text>You're a lucky man. You're a resilient bastard. The second scout troop that was sent after the missing men found you barely alive. I was able to revive you, but your nervous system might not survive the shock. You've been hit by a massive psy-op. That's the long and short of it. What do you remember?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_medic_quest_angel_first_dialog_2">
		<text>I remember coming to the place the radio operator pointed out to me. There was a bloody anomaly. And the people around it. It was like they were in a trance... Then a bang, another bang. They started shooting. And I started shooting, then it was empty.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_medic_quest_angel_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Those scouts were much less lucky than you. Their minds were completely destroyed by the psi influence of an unknown anomaly. And it's not even certain it was an anomaly. Well, how can I say it's an unknown. It's a rare thing. You probably haven't heard of it yet, but trust me, pretty soon everyone will be talking about it... Anyway, go and see our radio man. He asked you to come by when you get better. Plus, he'll give you the details. It was his idea to send you, basically, to the slaughter, so he can pay for it.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_medic_quest_angel_first_dialog_4">
		<text>Yeah, you're right. I think I'll go. He'll explain in more detail what I had to deal with. Thank you for saving my life.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_0">
		<text>What the fuck was that all about? You trying to kill me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_1">
		<text>I'm the one who's fucked, Varg. You know, this is the first time we've seen anything like this here. It's a miracle you survived, I agree. But you survived. We lost a scout troop. Well, that's a shame. Harold was furious as soon as he found out.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_2">
		<text>Of course he'd be furious. What kind of anomaly is this? Why wasn't this sort of thing known about? Or was it? If so, why didn't you warn me?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Not much is known about it. Here, in our territory, it appeared for the first time. It was the Black Angel. Not really a Black Angel, just an embryonic state. You've heard of it, no?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_4">
		<text>No, I haven't. Psi strokes, is that its effect? The anomaly seemed to work as a controller. It destroyed the Scouts from the inside. They attacked me and I had to kill them all. Then there was a shock and I only woke up at the doctor's.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_5">
		<text>What happened out there on the road - I know. The stalkers who brought you here gave me the details. You're doubly lucky they didn't kill you themselves. Now, about the psi hits. Now, that's a bit of a mystery. "The Black Angel, or rather its embryonic state that you observed, is incapable of creating such effects. And some of the more experienced walkers agree that the anomaly was merely a cover.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_6">
		<text>So you're saying that this is the work of some powerful psionic, who has subjugated the minds of a group of experienced stalkers? Did he create the anomaly with his mind as well?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_7">
		<text>It's not impossible. The Black Angel anomaly is real. Except it's already gone. It turned out to be unstable and couldn't make it to the next state as an amethyst vortex. And who exactly was exerting psychic influence under her cover is a mystery.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_8">
		<text>And what do you intend to do about it? A powerful psionic, whose motives are not yet clear, carries out a daring attack on the group's stalkers. You're not just going to let that go, are you?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_88">
		<text>What would you do in this situation? You won't just let it go, will you? The death of a group of scouts due to the actions of a psionic is no joke.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_9">
		<text>We won't let it go. But you're not going to get involved in this any more. We owe you too much for everything you've done for us. So, this time, we'll do it ourselves. By the way, I've been doing some more tinkering with the radar settings. I'm uploading something to your PDA. Consider it your risk. Anyway, check this out. These settings allow you to get data from the tracking systems you've installed. You'll be able to see stalker units and some mutants. That's what I've been working on lately and, as you can see, I've managed to get the system up and running. It's still in test mode, but it's already working. Only the stalkers in our clan will be connected to it, and that includes you. This thing will really help us save our lives.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_a45_radist_quest_angel_second_dialog_10">
		<text>Well, if I'm staying out, I'm staying out. If you say so. Thank you for that nice bonus in the form of a working radar system. It'll help us avoid mutants when we don't want to meet them. Cheers.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_0">
		<text>So, what other work do you have to offer, and why did you have to come in at night?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_1">
		<text>Hey. It's just a job. It's no big deal. There's almost no risk, but it has to be done. This time I need help testing the night vision equipment. So, you up for it?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_22">
		<text>I guess I will, but later.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_2222">
		<text>Not interested. I'm not taking it.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_2">
		<text>Yeah, sure. What exactly would the testing be?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_222">
		<text>Exactly how will the testing be done?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Well, here's the deal. You'll have a local stalker working with you. Well, think of him as my second assistant. He will measure some parameters, and you will take turns testing the devices. There will be three in total. One of them's a Contour, a Daedalus, maybe you've heard of them. You take turns running the test. Your partner takes the results and you go back. That's pretty much it. So, are we clear?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_4">
		<text>On the mission itself, yeah. We're clear. What will the results of this test affect? Are we going to buy a certain batch of equipment again?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_5">
		<text>It's just preliminary plans. Most likely only one batch will be purchased for our scouts. The rest, if they want, will be individual orders only. Things have become rather turbulent at the checkpoints. It's more expensive to deliver quality equipment without any problems than it used to be.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_first_dialog_6">
		<text>Okay. All right, I'm gonna go. I'll ask you something else on the subject later.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_1_dialog_0">
		<text>Hey. I'm from the technician. It's about the night vision testing. He said we'd be working together on it.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_1_dialog_1">
		<text>Well, hello to you, too. Yeah, we'll be working together. As far as I'm concerned, you know your mission. You run the device, don't go too far, test it for a while, while I take the necessary readings from the sensors installed. Is that it? If so, here's the first sample.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_1_dialog_2">
		<text>Yes, that's it. What exactly are you going to use to take the readings?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_1_dialog_3">
		<text>I don't know. I'm a one-time contractor, just like you. The tech gave me the equipment, told me what buttons to press, and then I'll let him figure it out for himself.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_1_dialog_4">
		<text>That's true.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_2_dialog_0">
		<text>So, did you get all the readings?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_2_dialog_1">
		<text>Yes. Here's the second device. We do the same thing. This one's supposed to be a little better quality.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_2_dialog_2">
		<text>Looks like it is. It's going up in quality. Heh, and they'll still buy some of the cheapest shit. Where do you want to put the first one, by the way?</text>
  </string>

		<text>You'll take it all back to the tech base later. About procurement. You may be right, but I'm not so sure. Equipment, if you really need it, you get the best here. It's a big business. The bosses have more money than you could ever dream of and they're interested in making their business flourish.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_2_dialog_4">
		<text>Let's hope you're right.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_3_dialog_0">
		<text>All right, let's get one last piece of equipment. Let's get this job done and then we'll go our separate ways. How much, I wonder, will the Turner pay for this business?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_3_dialog_1">
		<text>I don't know either. It's a trifling job, after all. But Turner's not a greedy man, he won't hurt your feelings.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_3_dialog_2">
		<text>That's true. By the way, how long have you been in their clan?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_3_dialog_3">
		<text>I've been trampling this mortal earth with them for four months now. It's all right, I'm used to it. It's a relatively quiet place. Mutants, of course - a lot, but stalkers of other factions are rare. And that can not but rejoice. At the junkyard, so now even ass is looming. Interests Dutya, Liberty, the Free and the bandits have crossed. It's gonna get pretty messy.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_helper_quest_pnv_3_dialog_4">
		<text>Yeah, you're right. But there are other interests at play here, too. But that's another story.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_second_dialog_0">
		<text>All right, my friend. We got the job done, we got all the numbers. My partner should probably give you the results himself -- he didn't say anything about it?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah, don't worry about him. You're paid separately for your work. You for yours, he for his. Give me the samples, and I'll count your share.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_second_dialog_2">
		<text>There you go. By the way, wouldn't it have been easier for you to do the tests yourself? It'd be cheaper, at least.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_second_dialog_22">
		<text>Take it. By the way, wouldn't it be easier for you to do the tests yourself?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_second_dialog_3">
		<text>And who's going to repair the equipment and gear in the meantime, you? That's just it. That's why I offer people all sorts of work that they can do for me while I'm busy here with my main duties.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_second_dialog_4">
		<text>Right. Listen, you were saying there's been some equipment supply problems lately. Is that something serious? What could it be?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_second_dialog_5">
		<text>I don't think it's anything serious. Everybody here is sitting on a gold mine, though it's not a gold mine, it's a platinum mine. Military men, stalkers, dealers, buyers, sellers - all of them make a profit selling artifacts. For the official world, the zone is a closed and dangerous place for people. But in reality you can see for yourself - there's serious business here for serious people. Everyone is hooked on it. Supply problems arise either when the soldiers do something for show, or when someone does not agree with someone in terms of kickbacks. That's the way it is.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b19_technic_quest_pnv_second_dialog_6">

		<text>Later. Why'd you call me? What exactly do you need to do?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_harold_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_1">
		<text>Specifically, we need to deal with Hasan once and for all. The man has done too much and it's time to put him down.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_harold_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_2">
		<text>And I take it I'm the one who has to do away with him?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_harold_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_3">
		<text>You got that right. It just so happens that you're the best person for the job. Of course, I'm sorry I'm signing you up for the bump, but the bastard didn't deserve any less. Besides, we need to take him out as quietly as possible.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_harold_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_4">
		<text>And why go to all this trouble? Wouldn't it have been easier to deal with him head-on? Especially since you've already got hard evidence of his guilt.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_harold_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_5">
		<text>I'm afraid he may still have some loyal men in the group. Not so much loyal as loyal. And this despite the fact that in fact Hasan is already a mercenary, working both for his personal interests and the interests of his patrons. The Stalkers in the clan may not accept the fact that we just come in and shoot him in front of the entire base. So everything has to be done quietly and peacefully, without any unnecessary noise. There are already a few options on how to do that.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_harold_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_6">
		<text>What options?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_harold_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_66">
		<text>What options?</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_harold_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_7">
		<text>Well, see for yourself. We could set up some kind of ambush. Call him out somewhere far into the woods under some false pretence and get him there. The radio operator can orchestrate a false transmission - that's not a problem. If you decide to work that way, tell the radio operator it's my personal order. Or you can deal with it right here at the base. The second way is more subtle. Basically do to him what he did to the scouts. I'll make sure there's an accelerant in his building and you plant a chemical charge. No one gets hurt in the explosion but him. So it's up to you to see what's best. The logistics guy here will help you with everything you need, and he'll let me know if you decide to go with the second option.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_harold_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_8">
		<text>All right. I'll decide what's best.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_b65_radist_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Hello, there. I need your help on a rather delicate matter.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_radist_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_1">
		<text>That depends on how delicate it is.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b65_radist_quest_kill_zam_first_dialog_2">
		<text>More than delicate. I need you to tell Hasan that there's been a disturbing report from one of the collecting parties. They've found a very rare artefact so rare it's worth a fortune. But they've been ambushed by bandits and need immediate help. In short, come up with something most convincing. Ultimately, I need Hasan to bite the bullet and go to this area in person.</text>

At the moment the faction has two unfulfilled contracts from the scientists of Yantar. The first is for the extraction of the artifact Black Soul, the second is to search for the Eye of the Dragon. The artifacts are very rare indeed, but we have learned to predict the possible occurrence of certain artifacts in certain anomalies. So the search area will be narrowed down considerably. In principle, if you have the will, you can take the job. One of two cases, your choice. But be aware that the Black Soul is also a dangerous artefact.

Remember this about the first day that both the Debtors and the Svoboda died. You didn't show up at that roadblock that day, you didn't see the freedom fighters there or work for them. You didn't see the Debtors show up and kill their enemies. You showed up there with a group of my scouts and found the bodies of both already cooling down. The attack by the freedom quad on you afterwards was a mistake. They mistook you for a Deog agent, but I convinced their leadership that you weren't. You got it? Forget that story and don't ever bring it up again if you want to live on this earth a little longer. And your destruction of the second freedom troop, that's for sure. You don't have to thank me, but if you happen to have any choice in the matter, don't forget that Harold was the one who saved your ass. All right, get out of my face.</text>
  </string>
	<string id="topi_b15_lider_quest_vozmezdie_second_dialog_44">
		<text>I got it. Thanks, though. Take care.</text>
  </string>
	
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Afternoon. I'm looking for work. Do you need any help? Maybe I can do something for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_1">
		<text>You too, stalker. Basically, everyone's maxed out right now. Deliveries, couriers... You know the drill. And that takes some skill and experience. Besides, you're new here. However, I think I have the right job for you. It's the fact that you're new here that we'll take advantage of.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_22">
		<text>I guess I'll come back later.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_2">
		<text>I'll take the job. It's just not clear yet what I'll be doing. Can you be more specific?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Of course. You'll have to run a number of errands for some benefit to the clan. It's a version for everyone around you and it's also a cover story. Don't look so surprised. In fact, you'll be primarily involved in one investigation. It was initiated by the clan leader Harold and is aimed at identifying those artifact collectors who have not started working for the good of the group. Recently there has been an increase in the sale of artifacts to leftist resellers, attacks on certain groups of collectors, as well as other sabotage of this kind. For example, the group's reserve caches have recently been looted. And it is believed that all these events are somehow connected. So we need to get to the bottom of this, and most importantly - we need a new person who can do some of the work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_4">
		<text>It's going to be an interesting case. I like that. But let me tell you, what makes you think the artifact collectors are involved?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_5">
		<text>They are. Be that as it may. No, of course you're right about something. The leader of this group isn't one of them, but there are definitely some links in the chain. Although there may be a definite ringleader among them. Ordinary ordinary bandits have already been caught and interrogated by our scouts. Some of them were clearly working under someone's orders and had handlers. But who gave those handlers the tip is the big question. Some of their own people are turning them in, it can't be any other way. And we need to find out who. We'll start with the collectors, or rather their handlers. Each group has its own divisor. He reports to several groups, to whom he gives current routes and other information, as well as collects the most valuable artifacts. We have three guides in all. They, in turn, hand over the most valuable goods to either me or our artifact specialist. And we'll try to check out those divisors first.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_6">
		<text>How so?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_7">
		<text>You'll be my new personal courier. I've already arranged with Jorah to alert them to your credentials. Now you will go to each of them and collect the artefacts they're supposed to be handing over. Try to get each of them to talk, looking like a simple layman who can't keep his mouth shut. Afterwards, start talking about the recent looting of the caches and tell them that you'll be tasked with restoring them. You tell each of them where the new cache will be. I'll text you the coordinates right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_8">
		<text>So the most important thing is to give each of them their own version of certain information? And you think they'll fall for it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_9">
		<text>Whether they will or not, I don't know. But you got to start somewhere. First do what I ask, and then we'll see if I'm right or wrong.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_first_dialog_10">
		<text>All right.</text>
	</string>

  <string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_1_dialog_0">
		<text>All right. I'm Isaiah's new messenger. He said you'd be in touch when I arrived.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_1_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah. He said that. Well, there's not a lot of artifacts right now. But what I do have, I'll get it to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_1_dialog_2">
		<text>Great. (chuckles) By the way, have you heard anything about the faction's looted caches? Rumor has it some looters found them. Now I'm going to have to lay a new one near the abandoned farmhouse. Oh, that's a pain in the ass.</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_1_dialog_3">
		<text>No, I haven't heard anything. That's true - I know you've been running back and forth. But bear with it - everyone's got their place.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_1_dialog_4">
		<text>That's true. Have you noticed anything unusual, by the way?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_1_dialog_5">
		<text>It's been quiet. All the pickers are taking orders. Mutants, as usual, up to their asses. It's just business as usual. We're just waiting on a shipment of new gear. So hurry Isaiah up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_1_dialog_6">
		<text>I will. See ya.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_2_dialog_0">
		<text>Hai. I'm Isaiah's new messenger. He was supposed to warn you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_2_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah. I got word you were coming. I'll get the artifacts we collected. Is there anything else you need? Any further instructions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_2_dialog_2">
		<text>Great. (chuckles) By the way, have you heard anything about the faction's looted caches? Word is some looters found them. Now I'm gonna have to lay a new one near the central roadblock. Oh, that's a pain in the ass.</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_2_dialog_3">
		<text>No, I ain't heard nothing. Guys didn't say nothing about any of this either. I'd know if something like that happened in our quadrant.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_2_dialog_4">
		<text>All right. Did you notice anything else out of the ordinary? You never know. Any clues will be important now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_2_dialog_5">
		<text>One strange mutant would be unusual. Looks like a controller to me. We spotted it just north of the village. We're waiting to see what they decide. Tell that to Isaiah. Who the hell knows what kind of monster's out there? The controller would have attacked, but this one's gone, which is troubling.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_2_dialog_6">
		<text>I will. See ya.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_3_dialog_0">
		<text>Hi. I'm Isaiah's new messenger. You should have heard about my arrival.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_3_dialog_1">
		<text>That's right-- I was told you were coming. I had everything I needed prepared. The boys will have some requests. Hand them over with the artifacts. There's been a long overdue shipment of new equipment, and Isai's been dragging his feet. It's making the guys unhappy. No proper binoculars, no detectors, no night vision equipment. What the fuck is this? Get him off his ass and get to work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_3_dialog_2">
		<text>All right, I'll tell him you said so. By the way, have you heard anything about the gang's looted caches? Rumor has it some bandits managed to find them. Now I'm gonna have to lay a new one near the south roadblock. Oh, that's a headache.</text>
	</string>
  <string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_3_dialog_3">
		<text>No, I haven't heard anything. But that ain't surprising. With fuck-ups like Isai, I don't know how it's still holding up. It's about time that lousy bastard got kicked out. I wouldn't be surprised if he was the one who blabbed about where the caches were buried when he was drunk.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_3_dialog_4">
		<text>Of course, that's your right to think so - but I ain't seen nothing like that in him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_3_dialog_5">
		<text>Heh, you ain't been here a week. Green as a mammoth's diarrhea. My advice to you, quit serving Isaiah. You should go to Turner. He's one of the few decent men in the clan. And his superiors appreciate him. Especially Hasan. Not like this under-supply man.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_freedom_sborshik_member_3_dialog_6">
		<text>I'll think about your offer. Goodbye.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_second_dialog_0">
		<text>I did everything you told me to do. Took the artifacts from them. Talked to them about a few things. I gave everyone a tip on where to plant the new hiding places. And now I think I know what it was for.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_second_dialog_1">
		<text>Glad to be the understanding type. One collector, we told him that the cache will be near the farm, another that the centre, and a third that the southern roadblock. Now we'll see which one of these caches will be looted, and that way we'll find the bastard.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_second_dialog_2">
		<text>We can only hope they make their move. By the way, one of the pickers or divorcees was behaving rather aggressively.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Who was it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_second_dialog_4">
		<text>A certain Mahir. He's very unhappy with your work. He thinks you're not doing a good job. Groups have been waiting a long time for new equipment, but they can't get it. In his opinion, it's your fault.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_second_dialog_5">
		<text>That's the way it is. That's good. We'll keep that in mind. Thank you. (chuckles) That's a very important observation. I just had a thought - I just have to see if it's right. When you're ready to work on it, come on over. Now we need to check the floats.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m1_snab_quest_second_dialog_6">
		<text>All right.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_c17_snab_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_0">
		<text>I'm ready to resolve the matter with the artifact collector Mahir.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_snab_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_1">
		<text>That's good. All right, here's what we're gonna do. I've consulted with my superiors and we've decided to eliminate him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_snab_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_2">
		<text>What? He must be an important link in the chain of command, right? His job was just a tip-off, someone must be above him. He should be questioned, in my opinion.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_snab_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_3">
		<text>That's right, he should. But I warned you not to ask unnecessary questions. Interrogation won't change anything. He's not the kind of man you can crack. Besides, I'm not sure we'll get him alive. We already have our suspicions about who he might be connected to. There's no point in confirming that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_snab_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_4">
		<text>I don't follow you. It's stupid to take out a valuable witness for no reason. But it's up to you. It's all your clan shit to clean up. I don't really care about the problem. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_snab_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_5">
		<text>His death should serve as a warning to all those who would try to betray clan interests. So consider that you're leaving a message for the customer in the form of Mahir's corpse. The men behind him are no fools, and they'll know we're onto them and can deal with them when it's convenient. Anyway, don't worry about it. Give this package to Mahir and that's it. It looks like a simple gun, but it's not exactly ordinary.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_snab_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_6">
		<text>It's up to you. I'll do whatever it takes.</text>
	</string>	
	<string id="topi_c17_snab_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_66">
		<text>Everything will be done as necessary.</text>

	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_0">
		<text>Good day to you. I'm from Isaiah again. This time it's about you personally.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_1">
		<text>Really? And he's sent me his pet monkey again. What's he lacking? The courage to handle delicate matters himself? When can we expect his bloody deliveries?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_2">
		<text>I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I don't care about your relationship with lsaiah, it's none of my business. Here's the thing. He asked me to give you this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_3">
		<text>Well, what the fuck is it? What do I need a simple gun for? I'm not interested in these toys, I want proper equipment for my boys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_4">
		<text>He says he's sorry. The shipment of equipment has been delayed. This gun is a personal gift. And a sample of the quality of the weapon to be given to some of the collectors.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_5">
		<text>All right. I'll wait. But my men will not wait. No more valuable artifacts for Isai or Jorah until they have proper equipment. You tell those bastards that. And don't scare me next time with their threats-I don't give a damn about them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_6">
		<text>Don't worry, I will. And I assure you, they won't threaten you again.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_222">
		<text>Mahir, I got some bad news. Isai has decided to liquidate you. I can't tell you much more than that, but I don't agree with him. That's why I warned you. If you have an alternate route for getting out of clan-controlled territory, now's the time to use it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_333">
		<text>That's how it works. The pet monkey's getting smarter before my eyes. And I take it he's expecting a generous reward? Well, I hope you weren't lying. Now, we're gonna head to the north roadblock, one hidden route. If all goes well, I'll disappear from here and pay you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_444">
		<text>Come on, we just got to get out of here fast.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_44">
		<text>I don't give a damn about anything. I've been ordered to kill you. But I don't want to do it. You're wrong, Isai. Very wrong. I'll keep you alive and get you out of here through the south roadblock, but you answer my questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_55">
		<text>That's quite a turn of events. Didn't see that coming. I guess I have no choice but to answer your questions. Just one question - why go through the south roadblock? Wouldn't you rather use the northern one? I got a better chance of getting away unnoticed there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_first_dialog_66">
		<text>Don't you fucking understand me? You go through the south one. If you argue, I'll shoot you where you stand. Go on.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_fake_dialog_0">
		<text>Hold it right there, boy. Slowly, don't move too far. You reach for that gun... You know what I mean, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_fake_dialog_1">
		<text>What the fuck is wrong with you? I saved your life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_fake_dialog_2">

		<text>Is this how you pay those who choose to help you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_fake_dialog_5">
		<text>And this is the payoff, my friend. You figured me out and turned me in to Isaiah. And now I'm forced to flee my place in search of a better life. So I guess we're even. But I'll get over this temporary hardship, unlike you.</text>

	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_second_dialog_2">
		<text>Selfish. Don't think I'm so kind and noble. A dead man's worthless, but a live one can still make a profit. Tell me, did you set up the attack on me when I told you about the caches?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_c17_mahir_quest_licvidation_second_dialog_3">
		<text>Yeah, I did. My orders were to sabotage the group. Loot a few caches, stage attacks on the collection teams the other divisors were supervising. The doers themselves were simple thugs - I only passed them the information they needed from one man.</text>

		<text>This man is a mercenary, but he is well connected to someone at the top of our clan. I don't know who exactly. Maybe it's that same Isaiah of yours. After all, he decided to eliminate me. Why, that's entirely possible. I screwed up and he decided to get rid of me. Although... Who knows now. Anyway, the important thing is this... Someone in the clan has some kind of arrangement with the mercenaries. What all this sabotage was for, I don't know.</text>

	<string id="topi_trader_pred_dialog_2">
		<text>All right.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="topi_snab_pred_dialog_1">
		<text>You're from out of town, aren't you? I'm sorry, but I can't help you yet. Oh, no, I can. But I need to know if I can do business with you. Our artifact specialist usually agrees to work with outsiders. If you can run his errands, you can come to me.</text>

		<text>Who are you, anyway? New guy? Well, get the hell out of here-- the pickers, the scouts. They're the ones you've got to talk to. They got a lot of degenerates... If you prove yourself, come back and we'll talk.</text>

	<string id="topi_var_1_suget_quest_final_harold_dialog_1">
		<text>Yeah, why? You've resolved all your business and you're still thinking about staying here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_var_1_suget_quest_final_harold_dialog_2">
		<text>Something like that. The purebred problem has been resolved and I have nowhere else to go. I can't go to Liberty or Duty, even though the conflict there has been hushed up. Becoming a looter or a mere mercenary is not for me. I am an outcast, tossed from side to side. All I want to find is peace.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_var_1_suget_quest_final_harold_dialog_3">
		<text>An outcast, you say? Don't exaggerate. You have no idea what it's like to be banished. I'm not retracting my words - our clan needs people like you. I have many plans for further development.

	</string>
	<string id="topi_var_1_suget_quest_final_harold_dialog_4">
		<text>Quite a promising idea. I could start working on making the right contacts in the north. I've been sitting on your marshes...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_var_1_suget_quest_final_harold_dialog_5">
		<text>Take your time. First, tell me in more detail what it is you've been doing here exactly. It is clear that you worked for the "Clear Sky", but as far as I know - your ways have parted and your last contract turned out to be a big problem for everyone. I need to know if you're going to bring those problems with you to the clan. Are you sure you've resolved everything? What exactly happened after you were supposed to meet with the Clear Sky agent?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_var_1_suget_quest_final_harold_dialog_6">
		<text>I repeat - the Pure Sky problem was resolved by me. So was the problem with the group of scientist stalkers. Nothing else matters. I'm here and ready to work. The rest is irrelevant...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_var_1_suget_quest_final_harold_dialog_7">
		<text>All right. Have it your way. But one way or another, I'll check out what you call "everything else." As long as you're free. Get some rest. I'll call you back when I have a concrete plan of action for expanding our presence in the north. Go on...</text>

	<string id="topi_d5_radist_third_end_quest_2_dialog_2">

	<string id="topi_d5_radist_third_end_quest_2_dialog_5">
		<text>Same place you do. He worked here for a while. Then he left. Varg, why are you asking me this unnecessary question? You know all too well, don't you? Everyone looks where it's best, or looks for the highest bidder. I've been helping him with some of his special business before you came along, and also after.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_radist_third_end_quest_2_dialog_6">

	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_0">
		<text>My respects. So, we meet at last. Well, the situation is cleared up, but there are some complications.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_1">
		<text>What's that? What took you so long to get in touch with me? What did you find out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_2">
		<text>Dutyo didn't get in touch because there was no exact information on the task at hand. I managed to find out details regarding your missing group. Traces of the group were found. Several bodies. It's likely that the group is completely dead...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_3">
		<text>We didn't get our hopes up, but, you know, hope is the last to die. So, what about the scientists? Were you able to find any trace of them?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_4">
		<text>I did, but that's where it gets tricky. To put it bluntly - I know where they are at the moment, I know where they have been hiding from you all this time, and I know that you still need them. I need certain assurances that once I put them in your hands I won't get a bullet in my head...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_5">
		<text>Well... Smart guy, huh? He guessed that the scientists were hiding from us in the first place. But it's not a fact that he guessed it himself - maybe someone told him? But it is not so important now. All right, what's your offer?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_6">
		<text>The old farms. No more than three men on your side. I come alone and bring the scientists. You hand over the money you promised me and we go our separate ways. My sharpshooter will cover the place so no one has any desire to violate the terms of the handover. If that's all right with you, let's discuss the time...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_7">
		<text>Aren't you afraid, boy? Who do you think you're making conditionalities on, the Clear Skies? Do you have any idea what we can do to you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_8">
		<text>When I got here, there was a Duty quad and a small Freedom squad standing in my way. You must have heard about that. As you can see, I'm still alive, and the two reconnaissance units of those groups are dead. How do you think I'm supposed to put conditions on some punk clan from the Southern Swamp that can't even find decent mercenaries to serve in their area of interest?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_9">
		<text>Yeah, we underestimated you. But that's okay, we'll make up for our mistake. Don't get too proud of your special position. Luck is fickle. There are many who want your head - don't add us to your enemies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_10">
		<text>Better to be among the living enemies than among the dead pawns... So, do you accept my terms?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_1010">
		<text>One more enemy, one less. It makes no difference to me now. So, do you accept my terms?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_11">
		<text>What assurances will you give? Why should we believe anything you say? Where's the proof that the scientists are still alive?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_12">
		<text>There are only three scientists left. You decided to kill them right after they handed over something valuable to Strelok's group. So, do you have enough proof of that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_13">
		<text>Quite enough. Wait, we'll get back to you...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_csky_svayznoy_quest_2_dialog_14">
		<text>You've been deceiving me from the start. I hope you won't make that mistake this time. I look forward to our next meeting.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_0">
		<text>I'm here. Why the rush, what exactly is so urgent?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_1">
		<text>And you're still asking? What's happened is that we've discovered an agent of the sinners. You remember I told you about them? Well, your new friend who's supposedly working for Freedom is actually an undercover agent of the sinners. His real purpose in being here is not entirely clear, but his plans for you are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_2">
		<text>And what are those plans?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_222">
		<text>What kind of plans?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_3">
		<text>Sinners are recruiting more and more agents. You showed yourself smart and capable enough stalker, who can not only stupid shooting critters and crawling among the anomalies in search of artifacts. And he almost recruited you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_4">
		<text>Aren't you doing the same thing now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_5">
		<text>No. I just want to keep you away from him and their clan. Sin is evil, it's the bane of the Zone. Thoughtless, soulless creatures who must be destroyed. And I'll do anything for it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_6">
		<text>All right, fine. Let's say he's a sinner. But what proof do you have of that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_7">
		<text>Do you remember working for Karim and Zmeelov? The first time, you ran into an unknown anomaly with a psionic undercover. The second time, the Yakut hunter disappeared. Well, Anubis did it all.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_8">
		<text>A psionic man, you say. It was probably the same one who attacked one of Limp's group scouts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_9">
		<text>Exactly. You're finally starting to get it. We have to stop him at all costs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_10">
		<text>But we don't know exactly what he wants...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_11">
		<text>But I do know what you want and how it all turned out in the end. And it's likely that the sinner's interests also align with the operation you're running here. You were supposed to meet with Clear Skies agents about your mission, weren't you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_12">
		<text>I was. Why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_13">
		<text>No good can come of it. Something else has come to my attention. I'm about to tell you what it is. And we'll need to build a coherent picture from these facts about how all the pieces of this puzzle are connected. Basically - Clear Skies hired you by deception.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_14">
		<text>Another twist. What the fuck kind of day is today... So these are the enemy, too? Who are you, then?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_15">
		<text>This is politics. There are no friends here, only figures who work in the interests of certain people. Anyway, here's the deal. "Clear Skies deceived you from the start. It hired you and other stalkers to search for its missing squad and the group of scientists the squad left after. In fact, that unit was not a search party-they were a battle group that was supposed to destroy those very scientists. These scientists had crossed the path of the Pure Sky, and they decided to eliminate them. The first attempt failed - the feathered warriors did not look too good. The scientists escaped here, I've already managed to find out where they are.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_16">
		<text>Okay, hold on. So I wasn't really supposed to save them, I was supposed to lead the purebreds out on them so they'd just kill them? Holy shit. It's called signing up. What exactly are these scientists so pissed off at the feathered?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_17">
		<text>They had to give one of the stalkers named Shooter some secret equipment. Shooter planned to go to the Center of the Zone to Chernobyl and Pripyat, and without that equipment it would be impossible to pass through the Burner. To Clear Sky, however, Strelok's trek is like a bone in the throat. They feel that it should not be allowed into the centre under any circumstances. That's why they've decided to take out those who've tried to help him. The PIeas have attacked the scientists, but they don't know if they've given Strelok's group the equipment. That's why they needed you to find the scientists. After you've done your job, they'll eliminate you as an unwanted witness.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_18">
		<text>Hmm, that's even more of a shock. Even the news that Anubis is an agent of the sinners didn't give me that much of a shock. What's in it for you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_19">
		<text>My gain is simple. It's an investment in the future. Pure business. No-one can even imagine what kind of riches the Zone Centre might hold. Unknown anomalies, mutants, artifacts. And that's millions. That's why it's to my advantage to make the trek a success. So we need to: first, figure out exactly what the sinner wants, and also figure out how to stop the cleaners. And if concerning the second - I know what to do, but with Anubis everything is much more complicated.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_20">
		<text>How exactly are we gonna handle this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_21">
		<text>Here's what we do. You deal with the purebreds for now. I'll try to figure out exactly what the sinner needs in this situation. Do not contact him under any circumstances. Forget about him for now. Understand? Work through Karim. He'll arrange for you to meet the feathered agent. Tell him you found the scientists, but you can't just hand them over. Lie, lure them out, get them to accept your terms. Tell them you're willing to trade the scientists for payment and guarantees and all that. They'll show themselves anyway. You'll see I was right. You'll probably have to humiliate them. Then I'll contact you with further instructions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_d5_killer_ceh_quest_1_dialog_22">
		<text>Good. I hope I made the right choice.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_0">
		<text>The Cleanerbug issue is resolved. You were right. They'd really kill me if I just gave them the location of the scientists. By the way, I never found them, did I? Do you have any information on that? And were you able to find out anything about the sinner's plans?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_1">
		<text>I found the scientists. Even before I met you. But I didn't get them out in time. They told me what really happened, how the purebreds attacked them and why. The good thing is that they managed to give Strelok's men the equipment they needed. Afterwards I left to look for traces of Anubis. But when I returned I found nothing but dead bodies. He beat me to it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_2">
		<text>That's too bad. What do we do now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_3">
		<text>Now we know for sure the Sinners agent is working on this as well. He cares about going to the centre of the zone. It's only unclear what profit they want to make out of it. Incidentally, I only found three dead scientists at the time. When I met them, there were six. I don't know where the others went. But that's not the worst of it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_4">
		<text>What else happened?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_5">
		<text>Hasan. Fucking bastard. Syndicate shouldn't have bet on that bastard. Should have worked with Harold. Probably would have done the same thing to him, though. Anyway, the locals found out you took out the Clear Skies unit. When you had a conflict with Duty and Liberty, they covered your ass. It's much worse with the feathered ones, though. Most likely the sinner did the same here. They've declared a hunt for you. So you're not allowed on the base.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_6">
		<text>That's great. So, what do you want me to do this time?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_7">
		<text>Nothing. Cover our tracks and head north. Hasan hasn't lived up to expectations. It's time to end this game. Yes, we'll lose a lot, but that's the price we pay for what we've done here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_8">
		<text>So I have to wipe out everyone at the local stalker base?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_9">
		<text>Yeah. Can't be helped. I'll give you whatever equipment you need. They've fallen under the sinner's influence. I have no other explanation for their decision. We'll eliminate them and leave. We'll have to control the march. To hell with Anubis. There's nothing more for us to do here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_m2_killer_ceh_quest_5_dialog_10">
		<text>All right.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_0">
		<text>Fair warning, I have nothing more to lose. I know about your abilities - just move.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_1">
		<text>Just relax. I'm not gonna kill you. I don't even have a gun on me. I could've done it more than once, but as you can see, I didn't.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_2">
		<text>Say what you have to say and we'll go our separate ways.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_3">
		<text>I'm curious. What exactly made you choose the side of that jerk Cseh? You know, there's not much difference between us sinners and mercenaries. Everyone wants a bigger piece of the pie. The methods of achieving that goal are pretty much the same - so why the mercenaries?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_4">
		<text>Their goals make more sense to me. Anyway, I'm just a mercenary who agreed to work for Clear Skies. What you want is a mystery to me. Why don't you enlighten me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_5">
		<text>I don't see why not. It's simple. I need to provide a way into the centre of the Zone and prevent those who don't want it. In this case, Clear Skies. You see, my goals are the same as those of the mercenaries...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_6">
		<text>We've already figured that out. You care about the Strelok hike for the burner, but exactly why?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_7">
		<text>That, my friend, is something you will soon find out. The mechanism has been set in motion and no one has the power to stop it. Have you ever wondered where the other three scientists that Cheh discovered have gone? Well, I'll tell you - they will be led out to the marshes, right into the clutches of those from whom they were trying to escape. The only difference is that it wasn't you who led them out, as originally planned, but another mercenary. And it is he who will play the key role in the future party. The gunslinger will begin his march and the man will follow. Many will die on their way, great upheaval awaits the Zone, but it's a fair price for the reward... At Pripyat everything will be decided.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_8">
		<text>What are you talking about? What fucking mercenary? What Pripyat?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="topi_k9_freedom_anubis_quest_6_dialog_9">
		<text>Pripyat, plain and simple. Anyway, I've been talking to you... I hope you understand the main thing - your role in this play. You've already played part of it, the other part is the preparation for the second act. I think I'll end on that note... And remember, you're just like me. You and I are both the same. Thank you for that...</text>

		<text>I met with Anubis. We managed to talk, but now he's dead. You're not gonna believe what happened.</text>

		<text>I cleared the base of clan stalkers. After that, the sinner got in touch and offered to meet me. I knew it was a trap, but I still went there to finish him off. But I was wrong. He wasn't going to kill me - we talked and then he shot himself...</text>

		<text>That's what you think. In fact, their meaning is very clear. There's going to be great upheaval in the Zone. And we're destined to be at the centre of it... Let's get out of here, I'll explain it to you on the way.</text>
