    <text> I don't lend money! What do you want? </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_text">
    <text> Hey, Savan. </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_bandit_logoped_start_dialog_text">
    <text> What do you want, buddy? </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_bandit_tick_start_dialog_text">
    <text> So, what's up with you? </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_0">
    <text> Stop right there! Who are you? </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_1">
    <text> We're scientists under contract... </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_2">
    <text> Do you know the procedure? Papers for inspection! Slowly. If anything, I'll shoot without warning! </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_3">
    <text> Here you go. </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_4">
    <text> Let's see... Stamp and signatures in place. Seems to be in order... But why are you on foot? Where is the escort? Where's Major Polischuk? </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_5">
    <text> Our car broke down, he stayed with it. It's not far, a couple of kilometers. We decided to walk, since we can't drive any further anyway. </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_6">
    <text> When are they going to replace this piece of junk? What are they thinking, for God's sake? They should be sent here for a day... Okay, here are your papers. You may pass. </text>
</string>

<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_7">
    <text> Thank you. </text>
</string>
<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_8">
    <text>Didn't understand! What did you smear your hand with, ink? Stop! Don't hide your pass. Give it here. The stamp is smudged! It's a forgery! Well, pray, scoundrel!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_army_shmatco_dialog_kpp_9">
    <text>No! Don't shoot!!!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_barman_patogen_about_zone_0">
    <text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_barman_patogen_about_zone_1">
    <text>I found the right person to ask! Ask the eggheads instead, they examine it under a microscope and put it in an X-ray. But I know a little bit about the Zone... It allows me to earn enough money to buy my own plot of land with a vineyard on the seaside in two years - that's it.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_fee_dialog_1">
    <text>Thank you, brother! You saved me - I won't forget it! Sorry, I don't have any money right now. But I'll pay you back later! And now, let me give you the coordinates of the stash. I hid a good sawn-off shotgun there on my last trip. Whatever you find is yours. I owe you my life, Savan. I'm in your debt.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_fee_dialog_2">
    <text>Oh, come on, don't mention it.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_fee_dialog_3">
    <text>Believe me, not everyone would risk their life for someone they barely know. Here in the Zone, it's usually every man for himself. Anyway, I'm heading to the ATP, I've got some business there. See you later, I think. Take care! </text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_fee_dialog_4">
    <text>You too, take care!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_0">
    <text>There you are. We've searched the entire camp. So, are you alive and well?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_1">
    <text>Yeah. I met some new people. From the swamps.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_2">
    <text>Are you talking about Dima? Well, we've known each other for ages, just haven't seen each other for a while. And here - a pleasant surprise. So, let's go to the village and discuss our business? I found something in Logoped's notes that I think you'll find interesting. By the way, keep your stuff, I can't carry it forever.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_3">
    <text>Let's go quickly, I'm starving - I have no strength left.</text>
</string>
 <string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_0">
    <text>Good thing everything worked out. They could have killed you. I warned you not to ask about the Freedom member directly. Anyway, let's not dwell on that. I found out a lot of things here.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_1">
    <text>For example?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_10">
    <text>There's a local resident here, an old man who's obsessed with clocks. He's supposedly a master of clockmaking. They say he's been living in this village since its founding, even before the first disaster in 1986, can you imagine? And he survived the second disaster too.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_11">
    <text>What good is that to us?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_12">
    <text>Just listen. Logopedist had some blueprints of old communications in his laptop: pipes, tunnels, ventilation shafts. I figured out that one of these tunnels passes right under this Clockmaker's house.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_13">
    <text>What are you suggesting? Break into the old man's house and search it?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_14">
    <text>Are you an idiot on Saturdays or what? Why break in? We won't break in. We'll ask him nicely. Maybe the old man needs something and we'll bring it to him, like a glass of water or something. Can you go and talk to the Clockmaker?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_15">
    <text>Why me? I'm no negotiator, I'm just a grunt.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_16">
    <text>I know you're no diplomat, that's for sure. But I need to go to Shaman's urgently, to give him Logopedist's laptop. There's still a lot of useful information for the free stalkers on it. I can't trust anyone else with it, not even you. No hard feelings. Don't worry, I deleted all the information about the catacombs from the laptop. So now, nobody knows about these underground passages except us.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_17">
    <text>Okay, I'll talk to the old man. Damn you.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_2">
    <text>I found out where they caught the Freedom member. Can you believe it? The bandits took him almost right near the rookie village.</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_3">
    <text>So, right here?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_4">
    <text>Almost. There's an iron hut on the hill. That's where they took him. Can you imagine, the bandits have never ventured so far into stalker territory before. It seems they had been tracking the freelancer for a long time. He was very important to them for something.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_5">
    <text>What kind of hut is it?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_6">
    <text>Just an ordinary hut, like a transformer or something. Only there are no electrical wires running to it, which is strange. God knows why it was placed there. Maybe for ventilation? It's impossible to find out, the door is welded shut.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_7">
    <text>So, what's in it for us?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_8">
    <text>Now here's where it gets interesting. Do you know Clockmaker?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_complite_9">
    <text>Who is that?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_dungeon_dialog_0">
    <text>There you are. So, did you find out about the dungeon from Clockmaker?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_dungeon_dialog_1">
    <text>Yeah, and not only did I find out, but I also got the key to the room that has the entrance to the dungeon.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_dungeon_dialog_2">
    <text>Excellent, I didn't expect it to be so easy. What did he ask for in return?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_dungeon_dialog_3">
    <text>Nothing. He just gave me the key out of the kindness of his heart. So, Borland, do you want to explore the dungeon?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_dungeon_dialog_4">
    <text>You're asking. Of course!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_dungeon_dialog_5">
    <text>Let's go.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_dialog_0">
    <text>Savan, you're alive?! You're something else! I've never seen a performance like that, not even in the circus. How did you manage to fall?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_dialog_1">
    <text>Oh... alive, alive... What can I do? I twisted my leg.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_dialog_2">
    <text>Come on, you're a lousy climber. How can you be so clumsy... Wait! I heard something.</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_dialog_3">
    <text>Um, what?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_dialog_4">
    <text>Shh! Follow me. Don't make any noise. Get your weapon ready.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_dialog_5">
    <text>Let's go ahead, I'm behind you.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_2_dialog_0">
    <text>What? This is the first time I've heard of such a thing as an inverted artifact. Do you think it's true, Savan?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_2_dialog_1">
    <text>Are you asking me? Who's the experienced stalker here, huh? I don't know about the artifact. Maybe it exists, maybe it doesn't. But I have heard the story about the Marked One before. In a different place, at a different time, with less detail. I thought it was just a pretty fairy tale. Looks like I was wrong... Something serious is going on here. And I don't like Skidan, he's clearly hiding something from us. He wants to use us blindly. Is that what we want?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_2_dialog_2">
    <text>Oh, come on, Savan. Aren't you interested? This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to touch the main mystery of the Zone. Agree! Do you know how much this artifact is worth? A number with five zeros. In dollars.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_2_dialog_3">
    <text>You're right. We came to the Zone for money. If this artifact is really as valuable as Skidan says, then I can go back to the Big Land with a lot of cash.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_2_dialog_4">
    <text>Well, that works too. Money is as good a motive as any. So I understand you. My motive is different - to get to the heart of the Zone's secrets.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_2_dialog_5">
    <text>Okay, let's go further into the laboratory. According to the plans, there's a sealed door with a code lock ahead. We need a key-card and a code. Skidan probably has it, but I don't want to ask him. He won't just give it to us, he'll demand something in return, like a favor or money. Wait here, I'll ask the Watchmaker for the key-card. He must have it.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_3_dialog_0">
    <text>Oh wow! I see you're dressed up. Skidan didn't skimp. Top-notch gear. He also gave me some nice equipment and a good gun.</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_3_dialog_1">
    <text>Can you imagine, someone broke into the Clockmaker's house and stole his access keycard to the laboratory. So, we won't be alone down there.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_3_dialog_2">
    <text>Who cares? We'll kill everyone if it comes to that. Everyone should be afraid of us now, we're like two terminators. Follow me!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_quest_line_research_underground_part_3_dialog_3">
    <text>Let's go.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_0">
    <text>Here we are, at the Cordon. I told you you wouldn't get lost with me. I know every trail here blindfolded. It's not my first time. Now, the most important thing: don't joke around. The military doesn't understand jokes. They'll shoot first and won't even ask for your name. Let's approach calmly, show our documents and leave. You haven't forgotten the cover story, have you?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_1">
    <text>I can repeat it.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_10">
    <text>Hold on a minute. Let me check your documents. Damn, the ink on your pass hasn't even dried yet. If it smears during the inspection, we're done for. Alright, try to be careful, don't touch the stamp with your fingers. Are you ready?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_11">
    <text>Ready.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_2">
    <text>No, that's unnecessary. And remember: if something goes wrong, these fake passes will lead us straight to the cemetery instead of the Zone. Or to prison. I don't know which is worse.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_3">
    <text>Do you think they'll notice?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_4">
    <text>They shouldn't, but anything can happen. The fact that the military didn't open fire right away is a good sign. But if push comes to shove, they might shoot. And then say that it was justified. It's not uncommon here, even stalkers with real passes have been killed. Like "good morning". The Zone will cover it up.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_5">
    <text>Is there any hope? I'm scared.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_6">
    <text>There's always hope. But, as they say, the odds aren't in our favor.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_7">
    <text>Are there any other options? I don't like the idea of going to prison, let alone the cemetery.</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_8">
        <text>Well, there is another option. If the soldiers don't turn out to be completely frozen, they will demand money. Which we don't have. So keep your face simple and don't wander with your eyes. Look ahead, but don't stare. Got it?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_borland_start_dialog_start_game_9">
        <text>Got it.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_0">
        <text>What are you looking at, ugly? Thought you were the smartest? I've seen a dozen like you in the past month.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_1">
        <text>Don't shoot. Please, don't shoot! Let me speak!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_2">
        <text>What can you say, you monster? Why did you try to sneak into the Ecological Disaster Zone through a guarded perimeter?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_3">
        <text>I wanted to earn some money. Let's make a deal.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_4">
        <text>You want to make a deal, huh? Then give me the money - and we'll make a deal.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_5">
        <text>How much do you need?</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_6">
    <text>How much are you willing to pay for your life and your friend's life? Let's say, 500 rubles each, that's still a good deal. He will stay with me for now. But if you ever think of betraying me, I will cut off his head and send a message to the free stalkers about who sold him. Then the Zone will seem like a dead end for you.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_7">
    <text>I will try to earn the required amount. I can do it! How much time do I have?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_8">
    <text>Maybe you can. If you don't mess around, you can earn it in a couple of days, I think. Just don't bring any junk here.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_prisoner_actor_dialog_9">
    <text>I will bring the money.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_0">
    <text>I brought the money.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_1">
    <text>Oh, our sponsor has arrived. We have been waiting for you.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_10">
    <text>Well, too bad. That means your partner will stay with us. We will make him pay every last penny. And if not, I will personally get rid of him. I will get an exceptional vacation for that. Or a medal.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_11">
    <text>Wait, please! Don't touch Borland! Maybe there are other options?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_12">
    <text>Hmm. There are a couple of options! Either you give your equipment to the regular army, or you do a couple of missions "and we're even," as Skidan says. What do you choose?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_13">
    <text>All right, take the equipment. I hope we never see each other again.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_30">
    <text>I'll do your tasks, no problem.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_31">
    <text>So, rookie, we lost one of our lieutenants. And some valuable documents that were on his PDA. The investigation showed that he was last seen in the north-west tower area, and at that time a Chimera attacked the outpost. We've been tracking this fast beast for several days near the swamp, but we can't catch it. Maybe it has a den nearby, and it's possible that it took the lieutenant with it. Your job is to retrieve the documents and kill the Chimera.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_32">
    <text>Sending me to certain death?</text>
</string>
	<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_33">
    <text>You're a stalker! You came to the Zone to die anyway! So let's get to it without talking. Or have you forgotten who you're dealing with?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_34">
    <text>I remember, I remember... I'm going.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_2">
    <text>As agreed, here are 30 pieces.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_22">
    <text>I changed my mind.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_3">
    <text>Bringing the money is good. But while you were away, the price went up. Your friend wanted to escape. He broke the sergeant's nose and tried to take away his gun. But he didn't succeed in anything. So now it's not 30, but all 40 pieces from you. As compensation for the losses.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_40">
    <text>Bringing the money is good. But while you were away, the price went up. So now it's not 30, but all 50 pieces from you.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_4">
    <text>Oh, you... Alright, here's another 10,000, to take them. Are you satisfied?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_41">
    <text>Oh, you... Alright, here's another 20,000, to take them. Are you satisfied?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_5">
    <text>Of course! It's nice to deal with a conscious stalker, unlike some. Well, if you're passing by - come in.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_6">
    <text>No-no-no. Once was enough. I wish I never saw you again.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_7">
    <text>Well, suit yourself. You're free to go! By the way, don't forget your gear - it's in a box on the first floor. And if you decide to come back, you won't forget where to find us! Ha-ha-ha! I'll warn my guys, they won't touch you, so come in if you need any work, we really need our own stalkers in the Zone.</text>
</string>
   <string id="esc_colonel_kolyazin_quest_fee_8">
        <text>I'll keep that in mind.</text>
    </string>

        <text>We have a hothead here - they call him Dubolom. He's a promising guy, but as impulsive as diarrhea. He wants to do everything faster than anyone else. When it comes to killing mutants, he's in the front lines. When it comes to searching for artifacts, he's indispensable. He hasn't been here for a week and he's already gone to the Dump. He thinks he's experienced, but he's still very green.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_13">
        <text>Well, I just arrived from Big Land myself. Isn't it too early for me to go to the Dump? Especially since I don't even know where it is.</text>
    </string>
   <string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_14">
        <text>Don't panic ahead of time. Nobody is sending you to the Dump. This stalker guy is already here, at the Cordon. A couple of hours ago, he sent me a message that he's returning to the camp. He wrote that he found something interesting at the Dump and wants to sell it to Skidan, a local trader. And I still haven't heard from him, even though it's only a twenty-minute walk.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_15">
        <text>What do you need from me? Find him?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_16">
        <text>Yes. Preferably alive and unharmed. But if something happened to him, at least bring back his backpack or any other belongings.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_17">
        <text>Where should I look?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_18">
        <text>In his last message, he wrote that he wants to cut through the "electric train," our local attraction. Start your search from there.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_19">
        <text>I'm not familiar with the area yet. Where is it, approximately?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_2">
        <text>Hold on, calm down! Tell me what happened.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_20">
        <text>First, you need to overcome the railway embankment. Since you're new here, it's better for you to go through the tunnel to the west of the elevator. Just be careful, there are some tough guys there - they collect a fee from everyone who passes through.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_21">
        <text>Tough guys? Bandits, you mean? How much do they charge?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_22">
        <text>It depends on who's passing through. They have nothing to take from you right now, so let's try to negotiate with them. The guys at the tunnel like to take newcomers by the collar, so here's a bottle, or two bottles of vodka, just to be safe. If you give it to them, I think they'll let you pass without any problems. You can return through the "electric train" - just climb onto a wagon and jump over the barbed wire on the other side.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_23">
        <text>Are there any other options? I don't really want to meet with bandits.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_24">
        <text>Of course there are other options! You can walk under the bridge. But even experienced stalkers are afraid to go there, let alone someone like you. It's so hot down there that one wrong step could be your last. And if you don't get burned, you'll turn into a golden crust in no time. So it's better to go through the tunnel - you'll be safer.</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_25">
    <text>And the bandits won't touch me for sure?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_26">
    <text>No, they won't touch you. Are they complete idiots to kill the hen that lays golden eggs? We stalkers are their only way of making money. They don't look for artifacts themselves, but they take their cut from us. Those are the rules here, it's easier for stalkers to pay for passage than to get into conflicts. And don't call them bandits, they'll get offended.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_27">
    <text>Yes, it's an unpleasant situation. Anyway, I'm going.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_28">
    <text>Wait! Where are you going without any gear, fool? This is not an amusement park - people even carry weapons to the toilet. Here, take this beginner's kit for free. It'll be enough for a while, and then you can get your own stuff. Do you know how to handle a weapon?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_29">
    <text>I had some experience in the army. Thanks for the gun! I'm going to look for your lost friend now.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_3">
    <text>I'm in trouble! I mean, we are. Me and my partner got caught at the checkpoint - our papers are fake, the ink blurred while the soldiers were checking. Now they're demanding money, or they'll kill my partner. And then probably me too...</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_4">
    <text>How much are they asking for?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_5">
    <text>Like I said, 30,000. 15,000 per person. So, are you going to lend us the money?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_6">
    <text>We're not going to lend you anything, this is not a bank. But we'll give you a chance to earn the money yourself. When did they say you should bring the money?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_7">
    <text>You have to do it within 48 hours, or... I don't even want to think about what will happen.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_8">
    <text>Don't worry, everything will be fine! But you shouldn't delay, you never know what they'll do to your friend. I see you're new to the Zone?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_9">
    <text>Yeah, is it that obvious?</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_0">
    <text>What did you find?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_1">
    <text>I found the backpack. I didn't find the stalker. Honestly, I didn't have much time to search - there are wild boars there. So, I guess Dubolom was killed by the boars. Sorry.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_2">
    <text>He's alive, Dubolom is alive! He rode up about ten minutes ago. His eyes are worth five rubles - he can't say anything coherent. We sent him to the basement to heal with vodka. And you're a hero! On such an occasion, take a bonus from me. Also, while you were away, I talked to a local trader. He's offering some work. The pay is not great, but it's stable. So, go see him if you haven't already. His name is Skidan, and he lives in a bunker behind the village. If you have any more questions, come see me.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_3">
    <text>What should I do with the things?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_4">
    <text>Just give them to Dubolom. Although, if we were being fair, we should teach him a lesson and not give him his things back. But never mind, he has already punished himself.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_5">
    <text>Thanks for your help, Pooch. See you!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_6">
    <text>There's nobody there. I found a torn backpack near the fire. But it's empty. Apparently, the boars took all the things. I didn't see the stalker either. Most likely, the boars got to him too.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_7">
    <text>That's too bad. But don't worry about Dubolom - he's back. He's scared and muttering something. But never mind, it's his own fault. He won't be showing off for no reason again.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_8">
    <text>Right. So, are you taking the job?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_9">
    <text>Oh yeah. Here, take this for your efforts.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dialog_wolf_the_first_penny_complite_x">
    <text>Hello, Pooch. I went to the "electric train".</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dybolom_habar_dialog_0">
    <text>Hey, hero! I brought you your things. You left them in the backpack near the "electric train".</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_dybolom_habar_dialog_1">
    <text>Oh, another one. I'd take a look at you if you were taking care of business and a boar came out of the bushes at full speed. I wouldn't have time for my backpack then. I don't even remember how I got on that train. The animals went crazy. Can you imagine? When I was walking from the Garbage, some creature jumped out of every bush at me. I could barely run. Pseudodog told me about you. Thanks for going on the search, I respect that. And leave my stuff, I don't need that junk anymore. I'll buy myself some new gear - you won't believe it!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dybolom_habar_dialog_2">
    <text>Glad to see you're okay. Thanks for the gear.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_dybolom_habar_dialog_3">
    <text>No problem. Hold on, let's exchange numbers. Here are the coordinates of my stash - there's an automatic rifle and spare ammo hidden there. Take it, for honesty!</text>

    <text>Are you kidding me? You're a funny guy. The Shaman called us for help. We were just thinking of moving to your location at the Cordon. We also took care of the bandits and freed you. Aren't you happy?</text>

<string id="esc_holod_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_11">
    <text>Happy? Of course! Thanks for saving me, I won't forget it.</text>

</string>
<string id="esc_holod_quest_away_from_the_bandits_dialog_6">
    <text>Well, not many people have heard of our group, even during its heyday. And now, no one knows us at all. Some call us the "Swampers," but we're really all that's left of the "Clear Sky" group. A scientific research group. It was... and then it was gone. But now it's coming back. And we're going to finish what we started.</text>

        <text>Well, I don't even know what happened back then. We still can't figure it out. Don't bother yourself with it, you'll just break your head. People smarter than you thought about it, but didn't come up with anything.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_14">
        <text>The Shaman is a decent guy, used to be a special forces or something like that. Of course, he's no match for the Dog, but he's been roaming the zone for many years and can easily outperform many stalkers with his 100 points ahead. He's a true leader and stalkers rely on him like on a rock - he won't abandon them in trouble and will share his last piece of bread. He's an honest, straightforward guy with a reasonable head on his shoulders - a real genius of tactics and strategy. The operations he carries out are amazing! In short, he's a trustworthy guy and a real stalker.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_15">
        <text>Do you know anything interesting about Mark?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_16">
        <text>For your money, anything you want. Give me 500 rubles.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_19">
        <text>Do you know anything about Borland? I'd like to find out more about him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_2">
        <text>That's an overstatement, I just sell a little bit. What do you want to know?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_20">
        <text>For that kind of information, my rate is always 500 rubles.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_21">
        <text>Will you give me change from a thousand?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_22">
    <text>Borland was a famous stalker. Didn't know that? He-he. He was a former motorcycle racer and street racer. He played guitar like a god. He was memorable for many things in the Zone. He killed the leader of marauders nicknamed Lavash. There was a lawless man here that old-timers remember. After that, the entire gang of marauders fell apart. It's hard for jackals to live together. Borland fought against the Monolith faction, not alone, of course. The "Horizon of Events" operation. Haven't heard of it? Many legends are still told around the campfire about it. Anyway, he spent 7 years in the Zone and then left everything behind. Probably got tired. \nAnd now, apparently, he's back. Why, don't ask me, I don't know. Former stalkers rarely return here, very rarely. Because the reason for returning to the Zone must be very serious, you know. They also say that Borland had a rich stash on the swamp near Agroprom, and apparently, he left it untouched when he left the Zone forever. So, the question is, why? If you don't need it, give it away for free or sell it. It's a matter of business, of course. Although, if he planned to come back, then it makes sense.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_23">
    <text>I don't know who else to ask. Can you tell me about the Zone? You've been here for a long time, you must have understood something about this place?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_24">
    <text>Oh, Savan, that's what you need to ask about. Give me 500 rubles and listen.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_25">
    <text>All ears.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_26">
    <text>So, with the Zone, it's like this: if you return with loot - it's a miracle, if you return alive - it's good luck, if a stray bullet misses you - it's a stroke of luck, and everything else is fate. You know what they say - the further into the Zone, the closer to heaven. Haven't heard that? Well, everything is ahead of you. You're a stalker, and stalkers are allowed into paradise without standing in line. The Zone is alive, it lives its own life, and we're newcomers here - we're just pulling chestnuts out of the fire. Artifacts, it doesn't matter... And it all depends on whether we're lucky or not. For the planet Earth, the appearance of the Zone passed without a trace, in general. Of course, it's not excluded that by randomly pulling chestnuts out of this fire, we will eventually pull out something that will make life not only here, but also on the whole planet simply impossible. That would be bad luck. However, it's always been a threat to humanity. Although... I've long since stopped speculating about humanity as a whole...</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_27">
    <text>Can you tell me something about the Strelok group? About Pripyat, for example?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_28">
    <text>Give me 500 rubles.</text>

<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_3">
    <text>Tell me about the Dog: who is he, where is he from?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_30">
    <text>The Ghost was a born spy - he could sneak into anywhere unnoticed. No wonder he was given such a nickname. It's just a pity he died. He went into the laboratory under Lake Yantar and never came back out. Ah, what a shame - he was a skilled stalker.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_4">
    <text>Information, Stalker, also costs money. Give me 500 rubles.</text>

<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_5">
    <text>Oh, well of course. Here you go.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_6">
    <text>Wow, isn't that a lot for a simple conversation? I don't have that kind of money.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_7">
    <text>I started writing my memoirs in my spare time, and there's a whole chapter about the Dog. Let me read it to you: "Sergei Yekimov (the Dog) and his family were always unlucky. His wife left him when he was fired from his job. He drank heavily at first. But one day, when his younger brother Peter Yekimov got mixed up with a bad crowd and was severely beaten, breaking his nose and arm - the Dog snapped. He took his father's old shotgun, found his brother's attacker, and shot him. After some thought, the brothers left for the Zone. At first, Sergei didn't have a nickname, and he was constantly called "Grey" until one of the experienced stalkers made a joke and recited a rhyme: "Grey Dog, Grey Dog, at the bread bin - click." And so Sergei became the Dog. As time went on, his experience grew, and the respect of the stalkers for the Dog grew as well. He became a mentor to newbies in the village. He walked all over the Zone and was considered almost a legend of the Zone." Well, what do you think? Can I put letters into words?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_8">
    <text>Do you know anything else? You're trading valuable information, huh?</text>
</string>
   <string id="esc_info_ot_sidora_9">
        <text>Oh, I see. Well, thank you for the information.</text>

        <text>It's simple. To be a Stalker means to be human. To help a comrade in a difficult moment, not to be a sneak, not to commit treachery. Share a medkit or a piece of bread, cover each other's backs in battle, share a night by the campfire. And our main enemy right now is the bandit scum, who only parasitize on our Stalker brethren. We are neutral towards other clans in the Zone. \nWe don't have an army structure, but a community of free people. You are free to decide what to do at any given moment. And no one gives you orders, not even me. Any questions?</text>

Everything's in order on the Dump, now it's time for the Cordons. We've already taken over half of it. To completely control this territory, we just need to drive out the stalker base at the ATP and show who the real boss is. And the newbie village - there are only wimps there. Look at them sternly, and they'll lay down for us themselves. So it's profitable to join us. I'm not pressuring you, think it over. So, what do you say?</text>

        <text>Here's the bag. The seal is intact, just as we agreed. You can count the contents if you like.</text>

    <string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_merc_dialog_4">
        <text>Great. Let me check the number... all good. I won't count it again - Skidan always keeps his word. So, are you coming with us or staying here?</text>

        <text>How's it going with Shmyga?</text>

        <text>You arrived just in time - the mercenaries are already on their way. Did you get some rest?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_10">
        <text>I'll figure things out once I get there. So, can I go now?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_11">
        <text>Hold on. If everything goes smoothly, I'll give you a generous 10,000 rubles. It's worth it for a job like this. Alright, go ahead now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_12">
        <text>You're quite generous, Skidan. I'll go do my job now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_2">
        <text>We'll get some rest on the other side!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_3">
    <text>Nice to hear from you! So here's the situation: there will be some mercenaries waiting for you near the camp of those degenerates, Shmyga's buddies. I'm paying them good money for this job. Here, take this bag of money. Deliver it to the leader of the group. And be careful not to mess things up! The bag has a seal on it, and I've already sent the mercenaries the number. If anything goes wrong, they'll shoot you on the spot. So be cautious with them.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_4">
    <text>But they won't kill me for sure, will they? They'll just take the money and say they did the job.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_5">
    <text>No, Savan, mercenaries are serious people. If they take on a job, they'll do it well. Otherwise, no one will ever hire them again. But if you ever come across them in the Zone in the future, it's best to stay away. If you interfere with their contract, they'll shoot you without a second thought. Do you understand what I'm saying?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_6">
    <text>Okay. But if it's so complicated with the mercenaries, why didn't you ask some free stalkers? They're closer, and they won't ask for as much money.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_7">
    <text>Everything should go perfectly, and no one but professionals can be trusted with that. Stalkers are a friendly bunch, but they can't keep their mouths shut. Okay, enough talk. The hired guns will be waiting for you near the rocks not far from Shmyga's camp. You'll give them the money, and you don't have to fight. The most important thing is to find Shmyga and take my case from him.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_8">
    <text>Are you sure there will be a case there? What if Shmyga has already opened it?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_9">
    <text>He hasn't opened it. I'm sure. It has a tricky lock that only one master in the Zone can pick. But I've already informed him about the theft, so Shmyga won't try to break it himself. Although he might hide the case somewhere nearby so that it's always within reach. So if you don't find the case with Shmyga, look for it in the camp.</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_complite_0">
    <text>Well, Skidan, celebrate! I dealt with Shmyga.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_complite_1">
    <text>Where's the case?!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_complite_2">
    <text>Here, here! Take your suitcase, Scrooge McDuck. Hehe!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_dangerous_business_sidor_dialog_complite_3">
    <text>Oh! Praise the Black Stalker! Well done, Savan! Take your hard-earned reward. Ah, now we'll live!</text>

    <text>So, how did everything go?</text>
</string>

    <text>They didn't even have time to be surprised.</text>
</string>

    <text>Nothing happened yet.</text>

    <text>Thanks a lot! Here's your reward!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_fighting_for_territory_kusto_dialog_0">
    <text>Shaman sent me. Need any help?</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_quest_fighting_for_territory_kusto_dialog_1">
        <text>Need help? Yes, we do. You see, we've just set up our base and haven't had the chance to clear the area around it yet. Bandits are everywhere, robbing stalkers who bring me supplies. At this rate, I won't have anything left to trade. Just yesterday, another group of bandits appeared. Brazen, they set up camp right in front of our base! Could you take care of them for us?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_fighting_for_territory_kusto_dialog_2">
        <text>No problem! Everything will be taken care of.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_fighting_for_territory_kusto_dialog_3">
        <text>You know what, maybe some other time.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_fighting_for_territory_shaman_dialog_0">
        <text>Can I help you with something?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_fighting_for_territory_shaman_dialog_1">
        <text>Yes, we have a problem. Ask our trader, he'll explain the situation.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_fighting_for_territory_shaman_dialog_2">
        <text>Okay.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_apparatyra_dialog_0">
        <text>Phew, I brought your equipment. It's heavy.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_apparatyra_dialog_1">
        <text>Great, Savan. We'll set it up now. The main thing is that it works.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_apparatyra_dialog_2">
        <text>Can I help with anything else?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_apparatyra_dialog_3">
        <text>Yes, Savan, but later. For now, you can take care of your own business. Just don't go too far, we'll need your help soon. Stay in touch.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_apparatyra_dialog_4">
        <text>Got it. I won't go far from the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_shaman_dialog_0">
        <text>What's the urgent matter? Stepa told me about it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_shaman_dialog_1">
        <text>Sit down. It's a serious matter. Pathogen told me about our dead contact. I don't know if Logoped knew about it, or if Shpala did it himself, but I'm sick of this. It's time to end these scumbags. Are you in?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_shaman_dialog_2">
        <text>Of course. What do you need me to do?</text>
    </string>
   <string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_shaman_dialog_3">
    <text>Actually, we don't need much. We have plenty of weapons, enough ammunition and armor for everyone. But we're really short on people. As you can see, there aren't many of us here at the ATP. I'm not counting the newcomers from the village, they're all inexperienced. To deal with the bandits once and for all, we need allies. The military won't help us, they're too proud. The Duty faction doesn't care about our problems, they're fighting mutants. The Freedom faction doesn't even know what's going on here, and they're neutral with the bandits. So, we're completely alone against these thieving bastards.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_shaman_dialog_4">
    <text>So, what should we do?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_shaman_dialog_5">
    <text>I have an idea of who could help us. Can you go to Skidan and get something for us?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_shaman_dialog_6">
    <text>Sure, no problem. What exactly do you need?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_shaman_dialog_7">
    <text>Skidan knows about it. I'll contact him now, and he'll give you what you need. And of course, don't tell anyone else about this. We need to keep this a secret to maintain the element of surprise. Alright, you can go now.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_shaman_dialog_8">
    <text>Got it. My lips are sealed. I'm on my way.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_sidor_dialog_0">
    <text>Hey Skidan, Shaman sent me to get something. I'm not sure what it is, though.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_sidor_dialog_1">
    <text>Yeah, I know what it is. Here's your box. Are you trying to make friends with the swampers or something?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_sidor_dialog_2">
    <text>What are you talking about? I have no idea. Wow, this box is heavy. And who are the swampers?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_sidor_dialog_3">
    <text>Oh, if you don't know, I won't spoil the surprise. You'll find out when the time comes. Hehe. And be careful not to drop the box, there's valuable equipment in there!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_help_nebo_sidor_dialog_4">
    <text>I'll try not to drop it too often.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_atp_dialog_0">
    <text>Thank you so much, Savan. I'll tell everyone in our camp how you helped me. Go see Shaman, he'll reward you.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_atp_dialog_1">
    <text>Alright, but how about you? Are you okay?</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_atp_dialog_2">
        <text>It will heal like a dog, the medkit worked. I feel a bit better. I think I'll go to the medic and get my wounds patched up.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_atp_dialog_3">
        <text>Take care of yourself, Leshy. And consider changing your profession.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_dialog_0">
        <text>Hey there. I thought you weren't coming. Did Ps send you?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_dialog_1">
        <text>Yes. So, you must be the best hunter around here?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_dialog_2">
        <text>Correction - the only hunter. They call me Leshy. Listen to me carefully - everything I say, you do unquestioningly: if I say stand, you stand; if I say lie down, you lie down; if I say kiss a boar on the ass, you kiss a boar on the ass.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_dialog_3">
        <text>Wouldn't you go, old man?!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_dialog_4">
        <text>Just kidding! Don't get angry. Just try not to make noise and follow me step by step. Let's go hunt a boar. There's one here that's as strong as a bear. He's already killed several people. We need to calm him down. Are you ready?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_dialog_5">
        <text>A boar's a boar. Show me the way.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_hanter_dialog_0">
        <text>We last saw the boar not far from the train tracks. There's a small hollow there - it's always damp, even on sunny days. Most likely, the boar's there. When we get closer, you go up the hill on the right and I'll go on the left. When you see the boar, drive it towards me - I'll stop it with my shotgun. And be on the lookout - there could be mutants there too.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_hanter_dialog_1">
        <text>Good luck.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_wounded_dialog_0">
        <text>Damn it, damn it, damn it! It hurts like hell, like they've ripped my stomach open. It's killing me. Do you have a medkit? I'll die otherwise.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_wounded_dialog_1">
        <text>Here's a medkit. You're not cut out to be a hunter, Leshy. You're as useless as a turd. You need to change your profession while you're still alive.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_wounded_dialog_2">
        <text>Sorry, I don't have a medkit.</text>
</string>
    <string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_wounded_dialog_3">
        <text>"Thank you for the medkit, Savan. I underestimated my strength... It's good you were nearby. Listen, I can make it to the camp on my own, no problem. But I'm not much of a shooter right now. Can you take me to the ATP? There might still be some beasts lurking in the bushes."</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_hunting_npc_wood_goblin_wounded_dialog_4">
        <text>"No problem. Hang in there, Leshiy, we're almost at the camp."</text>

        <text>"Any problems?"</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_hunting_shaman_dialog_2">
        <text>"No problems, Savan. I just wanted to talk to you as the leader of the stalkers in the Zone. Officially, you know. I'm the elder around here, although among free stalkers, it's just a formality, as you can imagine."</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_hunting_shaman_dialog_3">
        <text>"Speak, Shaman, I'm listening carefully."</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_hunting_shaman_dialog_4">
        <text>"Petya thinks highly of you. And now I see for myself that you're not just any guy - you helped Leshiy in a tough moment. Here's a small reward for you."</text>

    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_1">
        <text>"There are still good people in the world. Shaman's stalkers bailed me out. I knew right away that you wouldn't be able to gather that much money in two days. And Koljazin isn't stupid. On the second day, when the deadline was approaching, he came to me and started asking who else could pay the ransom for me. You can always count on being put up against the wall, but you can't make that much money that fast. So, I sent a message to Shaman, and he sent a messenger with the ransom. But Koljazin is still angry at you, so don't mess with the military anymore. And be careful, you never know what might happen."</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_10">

    <string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_2">
        <text>Oh, what a disaster. I had almost gathered the necessary amount, but I fell short. And Kolyazin kept sending me threats on my pager. And then he wrote that they fed you to the mutants, and now it's my turn. Well, I got scared and backed off.</text>

    <string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_3">
        <text>Yeah, it's an unpleasant situation. The Colonel will now make it his business to get to you - he's stubborn. Watch your back more often now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_4">
        <text>That's true, but let's not dwell on the sad stuff. How are you doing?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_5">
        <text>I'm doing fine, even though I got shot a couple of times by the soldiers. It's nothing serious, I've been through worse. Why did I call you? Will you be my partner? I've been in the Zone for many years, you won't get lost with me. Experience, as they say, is something you can't buy! My previous partner decided to quit the Zone and go somewhere else, maybe to the States or somewhere. He got tired, you know. And he made enough money here, enough for the rest of his life and even for his grandkids. I even wanted to go to America with him, but at the last moment I changed my mind - I can't live without adrenaline! So I decided to come back to the Zone and find a new partner somewhere here. And then I saw you crawling through the hole in the fence, and there was a minefield. I thought, well, that's it - the cat's done for. And me too, because they'll send me to the outpost for the explosion. That's why I decided to rescue you. It was just a coincidence. And now I see that you're not a total idiot, you pick things up quickly, and you're good at adapting to situations. And most importantly - you don't whine. I'll teach you a few tricks of the trade, and you'll become an excellent stalker. So, are you in?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_6">
        <text>I'm not against it. You seem like a reliable guy. Do you have a plan for what's next? I've had my fill of the Cordon and realized that there's not much money to be made here. Should we head north together? Or maybe towards the center of the Zone? I've heard different things about the center, don't know if they're true. But apparently, everything there is made of pure gold. Or something like that.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_7">
        <text>Hold on a minute, what kind of Zone center can we reach with our ragtag group? First, we need to get some gear and better weapons. There's no gold in the center of the Zone, but we can strike it rich there. And make flippers there too. Even faster than striking it rich. That's why we need good... </text>
    </string>
    <string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_8">
        <text>So, what's your plan?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_borland_meet_dialog_9">
        <text>My plan is a clean thermonuclear bomb! Just kidding. I do have a plan. I'm going to chat with Skidan. He asked me for some service, to go somewhere or something like that. I can't refuse - he'll get offended. But I'll try to bargain with him for some cheap gear in return. So, I might be gone for a day or two. Don't just sit around doing nothing. Go see Pathogen and Shaman, they started something but it didn't work out. Maybe they need some help. Who knows, you might even earn a bit. Every penny counts for us now.</text>

        <text>Hello buddy! How are you doing?</text>

</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_important_meet_borland_dialog_10">
        <text>Let me try. So... Mm-hmm... Wow... Is that all? That's interesting... What kind of artifact did they snatch from the Monolith? And I've never heard about a lab near the Cordon. There are some service tunnels here, but no one knows where they lead. And the strangest thing is that the Monolith agent was wearing a Freedom mask. Nobody will believe it if you tell them!</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_important_meet_borland_dialog_11">
        <text>Do you think what's written in the PDA is true? I mean, about the artifact and the lab?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_important_meet_borland_dialog_12">
        <text>If there was an artifact, someone has probably already found it and sold it to Skidan or someone else. But I wouldn't mind checking out the information about the lab. Can you imagine if no stalker has been there yet? You can gather so much stuff there! And we won't need any artifact Klondike.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_important_meet_borland_dialog_13">
        <text>So, what's next?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_important_meet_borland_dialog_14">
        <text>I'll try to find out about the catacombs from Skidan. He's been sitting in his basement for so long, he's practically one of the first stalkers. He must know something. And your mission, bro, is the most responsible - go see Logoped. You haven't had a falling out with him, have you? Do you talk normally? Try to get something out of him about the Freedom captive. The bros still don't know that they had a Monolith guy in captivity. Try to find out where they caught him, maybe the entrance to the catacombs is nearby. Just be careful, don't mess with the bros...</text>

        <text>No way! Someone tried to smash my skull on the elevator! Somebody crept up behind me and hit me straight on the head. It's still ringing. I was unconscious, but they didn't take anything. Everything is still with me, can you believe it?</text>

        <text>I was looking for Stepka there, he was supposed to unlock the Stalker PDA for me. And I found him. But it was too late - Stepka was killed.</text>

<string id="esc_quest_line_important_meet_borland_dialog_6">
        <text>Wow! Who killed Stepka? And what was in the PDA? Tell me everything in order.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_important_meet_borland_dialog_7">
        <text>I freed a Stalker from the bandits captivity, and instead of saying "thanks", he just shot himself in the head. I took his PDA and searched for Stepka to unlock it and see what's inside.</text>

        <text>And?</text>

        <text>Here's the PDA. I didn't understand a damn thing. Some kind of encryption, I didn't understand half of the words. Maybe you'll be able to figure it out?</text>

        <text>Go ahead.</text>
</string>
   <string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_3">
    <text>Shaman and I decided that we can't afford to lose people in clashes with bandits anymore. Even the stalkers are tired of fighting, and not everyone can pass through the "Bakery". So we decided to make a deal with the gang - they let our people pass through the tunnel freely, and we give them a percentage of our earnings once a week. The negotiator seemed happy with the terms. We sent our contact person with the agreement, but he never made it to Logoped. I have no idea where he could have gone - he vanished into thin air. We don't want to jump to conclusions about the gang too soon, especially since it's in everyone's best interest to honor the agreement. But our contact person has disappeared, so what happened to him?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_4">
    <text>Why did you send him without any protection?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_5">
    <text>That's the thing - we didn't expect any foul play. I've known Logoped for a long time, we crossed paths a few years ago. He may be a bandit, but he keeps his word. However, he and our Shaman don't get along - they had a falling out. That's why I handle all the negotiations with Logoped. And he's clearly not involved in this.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_6">
    <text>Could Logoped have enemies among his own people who want to set him up?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_7">
    <text>That was also a possibility - someone really doesn't want us to make a deal with the gang. And I have a hunch about who that might be.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_8">
    <text>And who is it?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_9">
    <text>They have a real piece of work in their camp named Shpala. He threatened to kill all the free stalkers, but Logoped keeps him on a short leash. This Shpala could have pulled something behind his boss's back. Here's the plan: I'll give you Shpala's radio frequency. Our technician Stepka has golden hands, he's already hacked into all the gang leaders' radios. They don't have their own technician, so they call Stepka whenever something breaks. And Stepka isn't dumb - he's already cracked their frequencies and codes, so we can monitor all their movements at any time. So, keep an eye on Shpala: what he's doing, where he's going, and who he's talking to.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_one_0">
    <text>I've been keeping an eye on Shpala.</text>

    <string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_one_1">
    <text>Do you have any leads on our contact?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_one_2">
    <text>Yes, but the news is bad. Our contact is dead. The bandits killed him, but I don't think it's as simple as it seems.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_one_3">
    <text>This is what I feared. Did Shpala decide to betray the Speech Therapist? Or did the Speech Therapist know everything? But then why did they kill our guy? There are many questions, but no answers. Here, take this as payment for your work.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_one_4">
    <text>That's not all. Besides your contact and the bandits, there was another stalker there. Judging by the patch on his armor, he was from the "Freedom" clan. But he was completely frozen - I killed the bandits, and this "Freedom" guy picked up a gun from the ground and shot himself. Can you imagine? He put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger without saying a word.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_one_5">
    <text>What? You're kidding me. He shot himself? Yeah, right. Don't lie to me. We haven't seen anyone from "Freedom" around here for a long time. What are they doing here? And I definitely don't believe he shot himself. Maybe they like to smoke weed or something hallucinogenic, but to commit suicide - you're a storyteller. Anyway, here's 500 rubles for your interesting story, go buy yourself a flag. I'll take care of serious matters - the bandits can't get away with killing our contact.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_one_6">
    <text>You're wrong, Patogenych, that's exactly what happened. Anyway, it's your business. Goodbye for now.</text>

<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_two_0">
    <text>I've been watching Shpala.</text>

    <text>Did you find out anything about our contact?</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_two_2">
    <text>I'm not 100% sure, but he's probably dead. I didn't get too close, but I saw a dead stalker there. Most likely, that's your contact.</text>
</string>
<string id="esc_quest_line_patogen_meet_dialog_complite_two_3">
    <text>What if it's not him? Although, who am I kidding. That dead guy is probably our contact. Poor guy. But the bandits can't get away with this, whether or not the Speech Therapist knew about it. Those bastards need to be punished. Here's your payment - thanks for keeping an eye on things.</text>
